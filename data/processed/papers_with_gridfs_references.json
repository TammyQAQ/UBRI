    "abstract": "The trustless nature of permissionless blockchains renders overcollateralization a key safety component relied upon by decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Nonetheless, factors such as price volatility may undermine this mechanism. In order to protect protocols from suffering losses, undercollateralized positions can be liquidated. In this paper, we present the first in-depth empirical analysis of liquidations on protocols for loanable funds (PLFs). We examine Compound, one of the most widely used PLFs, for a period starting from its conception to September 2020. We analyze participants' behavior and risk-appetite in particular, to elucidate recent developments in the dynamics of the protocol. Furthermore, we assess how this has changed with a modification in Compound's incentive structure and show that variations of only 3% in an asset's dollar price can result in over 10m USD becoming liquidable. To further understand the implications of this, we investigate the efficiency of liquidators. We find that liquidators' efficiency has improved significantly over time, with currently over 70% of liquidable positions being immediately liquidated. Lastly, we provide a discussion on how a false sense of security fostered by a misconception of the stability of non-custodial stablecoins, increases the overall liquidation risk faced by Compound participants.",

We analyzed daily stock price and daily social media sentiment for the top 50 companies in the Standard & Poor (S&P) index during the period from November 2018 to November 2020. We also analyzed news mentioning these companies during the same period. We found that there is a causal flux of information that links those companies. The largest fraction of significant causal links is between prices and between sentiments, but there is also significant causal information which goes both ways from sentiment to prices and from prices to sentiment. We observe that the strongest causal signal between sentiment and prices is associated with the Tech sector.",

    "abstract": "This paper reviews the impact of data science and artificial intelligence (AI) on future ‘datadriven’ insurance markets. The impact of insurance automation (driven by so-called Black Swan1 events such as Covid-19) mirrors the impact of algorithmic trading that changed radically the capital markets (Koshiyama et al., 2020). The data science technologies driving change include: Big data, AI analytics, Internet of Things, and Blockchain technologies. These technologies are important since they underpin the automation of the insurance markets and risk analysis, and provide the context for the algorithms, such as AI machine learning and computational statistics, which provide powerful analytics capabilities. New AI algorithms are constantly emerging, with each ‘strain’ mimicking a new form of human learning, reasoning, knowledge, and decision-making. The current main disrupting forms of learning include deep learning, adversarial learning, federated learning, transfer and meta learning. Albeit these modes of learning have been in the AI/ML field more than a decade, they are now more applicable due to the availability of data, computing power and infrastructure. These forms of learning have produced new models (e.g., long short-term memory, generative adversarial networks) and leverage important applications (e.g., Natural Language Processing, Adversarial Examples, Deep Fakes, etc.). These new models and applications will drive changes in future insurance markets, so it is important to understand their computational strengths and weaknesses. The contribution of this paper is to review the data science technologies and specifically AI algorithms, their computational strengths and weaknesses, and discuss their future impact on the insurance markets.",

Entrepreneurs' ability to signal quality is crucial to succeeding in the competition for growth capital. However, the absence of institutions that verify endogenous signals may induce a moral hazard in signaling. Consistent with this hypothesis, artificial linguistic intelligence indicates that token issuers systematically exaggerate information disclosed in whitepapers. Exaggerating entrepreneurs raise more funds in less time, suggesting that investors do not see through this practice initially. Eventually, the crowd learns about the exaggeration bias through trading with other investors. The resulting investor disappointment causes the cryptocurrency to depreciate and the probability of platform failure to increase.",

    "abstract": "A defining feature of initial coin offerings (ICOs) is that entrepreneurs bear the full marginal investment cost but profit only partially from the marginal investment payoff. This design may exacerbate agency conflicts inherent in corporate finance. As a consequence, signals of entrepreneurial quality such as CEO loyalty, which is an established concept in social psychology and can easily be linked to potential agency conflicts in corporate settings, might be a first-order determinant of economic outcomes in the ICO market. Consistent with this, I find that loyal CEOs have to offer lower financial incentives to attract investors and are still able to raise more proceeds, conduct ICOs more thoroughly, and are less likely to fail. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that asymmetric information between entrepreneurs and investors entail agency costs that are decreasing in CEO loyalty.",

However, using artificial emotional intelligence, positive and negative affects can be identified from facial muscle contraction-relaxation patterns obtained from public CEO photos during initial coin offerings, that is, blockchain-based issuances of cryptocurrency tokens to raise growth capital. The results suggest that CEO affects impact firm valuation in two ways. First, CEOs' own firm valuations conform more to those of industry peers if negative affects are pronounced (conformity mechanism). Second, investors use CEO affects as signals about firm value and discount when negative affects are salient (signaling mechanism). Both mechanisms are stronger in the presence of asymmetric information.",

Blockchain technology allows consumers to track the flow of food products and reduce food fraud, such as counterfeiting, dilution, or adulteration. Using three experiments conducted with Austrian business students as well as an online convenience sample, we investigate how the traceability of food products impacts consumers' trust in the retailer and subsequently influences consumers' retailer choice. Our model further considers retailer familiarity and the disclosure of blockchain benefits as important moderators of the impact of blockchain-based traceability systems on trust in the retailer. The model was tested using ANOVA, ANCOVA, and Hayes’ PROCESS models. In terms of fostering consumer trust, the findings show that retailers who are unfamiliar to consumers profit more from the use of blockchain technology than do better-known retailers. Moreover, informing consumers about specific blockchain benefits strengthens the positive effects of a blockchain-based traceability system.",

In the tourism industry, though many tourism vendors have been accepting cryptocurrencies and the potential of using cryptocurrencies in travel-related consumption has been intensively documented, existing knowledge about travellers’ intention to use cryptocurrencies for payment purposes is limited. Traditional models do not account for the idiosyncrasies of cryptocurrencies and are therefore less appropriate to foster the understanding of travellers’ adoption of travel-related payments. To fill this knowledge gap, an exploratory study was conducted with 161 travellers from the Asia-Pacific region who have previously consumed travel-related services with cryptocurrencies. Their previous usage experiences are analysed and reported. Through harnessing the correspondence analysis, several technological contingency factors were identified, as well as positive and negative perceptual antecedents. Additionally, their levels of satisfaction and intention to re-use the technology in future trips were investigated. Based on these findings, several propositions are suggested for guiding future research on travellers’ cryptocurrency adoption in the travel and tourism contexts.",

The occurrence and the co-occurrence of fintech terms and locutions show a progressive evolution of the list of fintech terms in a compact and coherent set of terms used worldwide to describe fintech business activities. By using methods of complex networks that are specifically designed to deal with heterogeneous systems, our analysis of a large set of professional descriptions of companies shows that companies having fintech terms in their description present over-expressions of specific attributes of country, municipality, and economic sector. By using the approach of statistically validated networks, we detect geographical and economic overexpressions of a set of companies related to the multi-industry, geographically, and economically distributed fintech movement.",

Using novel data on ICO analysts' backgrounds, we show that more favorable ratings by analysts with proper expertise significantly predict fundraising success. Analyst ratings also help detect potential fraud ex ante. We document that analysts are incentivized to issue informative ratings to advance their careers in future ICOs. Analyst ratings positively predict long-run token returns and negatively predict return volatility. Overall, our results suggest that a market-based certification process that builds on the expertise and incentives of analysts is at play in financing blockchain startups.",

Since the introduction of Bitcoin futures coincided with this market crash, it is said that the new financial instrument might have caused the market crash. The literature states that the futures enabled investors to easily take a short position and hypothesizes that the selling pressure from futures could have potentially crashed the Bitcoin market. To evaluate this assumption, we investigate the empirical relationship between futures trading and the Bitcoin price by using highfrequency data. We find that Bitcoin futures trading was not significantly related to the returns on Bitcoin futures and spot returns. Therefore, we conclude that Bitcoin futures did not lead to the crash of the Bitcoin market at the end of 2017.",

The application of TEA remediates a number of issues or “pain points” in the accounting domain, from multi-party logistic nightmares and billing inefficiencies to “creative accounting.” An inventory of current practice further reveals that, although not intended to serve as an ultimate accounting tool in most cases, DLT has been used to develop a quasi or full TEA application in many separate instances. DLT developers are, with innovative TEA applications, breaking new ground in the accounting world, especially in the logistics and supply chains sectors. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the efficiency effects may well surpass the primary DLT-based TEA input costs, in particular given the addition of single truth: a common, shared ledger with IoT oracles between parties potentiates an agreed understanding of the facts. A TEA system thus reduces friction between parties, and thus lowers costs related to reconciliation and risk management.",

Improving upon the long-standing double-entry systems, solutions such as the Resource-Event-Agent (REA) accounting framework, triple-entry accounting (TEA) and blockchain have been advanced. However, to date, the historical development of shared ledger systems remains murky. This paper conducts a genealogical analysis of shared ledger systems, in particular tracing the development of REA, TEA and blockchain. We show how the REA framework had a distinct influence over independent streams of research in the field of TEA, and how this interaction may be traced to the present incarnation of shared ledger systems in blockchain. In doing so, we duly acknowledge the influence of each individual contributing to this development, correct common misconceptions and map out how the paths of REA, TEA and blockchain overlap in the realm of shared ledger systems.",

Introducing P2P transactions to an essential service such as energy could have far-reaching implications for individuals and the grid. This paper raises considerations and questions from social, economic/markets and regulatory points of view, that should be understood and addressed by societies and policymakers. It does this by considering under what circumstances it is reasonable to conceptualize P2P energy trading as part of the sharing economy, and drawing parallels to the sharing economy experience in other sectors. In order to reap the full societal benefits, while avoiding considerable risks to infrastructure and individuals, a policy approach promoting dialogue and innovation is necessary. We suggest the regulatory sandbox is the most appropriate tool to achieve this and would help avoid the breakdown of trust between policymakers and platform companies observed in other sectors.",

We apply shocks to a group of stocks in a part of the market, and we quantify the effects in terms of average losses on another part of the market using a sparse probabilistic elliptical model for the multivariate return distribution of the whole market. Sparsity is introduced with an L0-norm regularization, which forces to zero some elements of the inverse covariance according to a dependency structure inferred from an information filtering network. Our study concerns the FTSE 100 and 250 markets and analyzes impact and response to shocks both applied to and received from individual stocks and group of stocks. We observe that the shock pattern is related to the structure of the network associated with the sparse structure of the inverse covariance of stock returns. Central sectors appear more likely to be affected by shocks, and stocks with a large level of underlying diversification have a larger impact on the rest of the market when experiencing shocks. By analyzing the system during times of crisis and comparative market calmness, we observe changes in the shock patterns with a convergent behavior in times of crisis.",

    "abstract": "Bonds issuance is a highly technical and complicated process, entailing mutually untrusted stakeholders with sometimes conflicting objectives. Currently, the global bond market is faced with several pain points when it comes to bond issuance, like disparate regulatory frameworks, limited traceability and auditability, settlement failures, and inefficient issuance processes. Block-chain technology is capable of addressing some of the issues mentioned above. In this paper, we propose a block-chain-enabled green bond issuance architecture. In particular, we develop an adaptable and efficient system that reduces the intermediary costs and offers compliance, scalability, confidentiality, and security. The block-chain-enabled system also acts as a transparent yet fully controllable decentralized authority where the funds of qualified, environmentally friendly projects could be traced. Our proposed architecture considers the various aspects and the complexity of the bond issuance procedures and the special requirements of green bonds. The architecture is based on a five-step model from green bond initialization to archiving. To adjust the processes of bond issuance to a block-chain-enabled model, we use digital tokens based on the ERC-20 token standard. Within the smart contracts developed, we use various functions to handle the prerequisites of validators and regulators’ approval based on the documentation presented and the parameters of rate and maturity requested by the issuer. We use a separate smart contract to implemented forensic services. The overall system also considers various regulatory compliance instruments and enhances access of regulatory bodies to issuance records. We believe that the proposed architecture could be of significant value to researchers and practitioners from the financial domain.",

Our theoretical model predicts that (i) the Bitcoin price and the total hash rate are determined simultaneously in the long-run and (ii) the hash rate of Bitcoin Granger-causes Bitcoin prices in the short-run. Using a cointegration framework, our empirical analysis provides consistent results with these theoretical predictions. Our empirical results suggest that the Bitcoin market has been under a fundamental value instead of speculative bubbles.",

    "abstract": "To date, cryptocurrency prices are volatile and many cryptocurrency developers have adopted ad hoc approaches to stabilize their cryptocurrency price. When these currencies are not 100% backed by other valued assets, part of their price volatility may arise from self-fulfilling expectations of a speculative attack (as in Obstfeld (1996)). We show that an exchange rate policy, which is less than 100% backed and dynamically adjusts in response to traders’ conversion demand eliminates speculative attacks while, under some conditions, preserving much of the desired exchange rate stability. This dynamic exchange rate policy admits a great deal of discretion to and requires commitment by the party implementing the policy. We demonstrate how to implement this policy using the Ethereum network—a smart contract blockchain environment—and how this implementation yields commitment to the policy.",

In this paper we explore this new paradigm through a study of BitMEX, one of the frst and most successful derivatives platforms for leveraged cryptocurrency trading. BitMEX trades on average over 3 billion dollars worth of volume per day, and allows users to go long or short Bitcoin with up to 100x leverage. We analyze the evolution of BitMEX products—both settled and perpetual offerings that have become the standard across other cryptocurrency derivatives platforms. We additionally utilize on-chain forensics, public liquidation events, and a site-wide chat room to describe the diverse ensemble of amateur and professional traders that forms this community. These traders range from wealthy agents running automated strategies, to individuals trading small, risky positions and focusing on very short time-frames.

    "abstract": "Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies offer an appealing alternative to Fiat currencies, due to their decentralized and borderless nature. However the decentralized settings make the authentication process more challenging: Standard cryptographic methods often rely on the ability of users to reliably store a (large) secret information. What happens if one user's key is lost or stolen? Blockchain systems lack of fallback mechanisms that allow one to recover from such an event, whereas the traditional banking system has developed and deploys quite effective solutions. In this work, we develop new cryptographic techniques to integrate security policies (developed in the traditional banking domain) in the blockchain settings. We propose a system where a smart contract is given the custody of the user's funds and has the ability to invoke a two-factor authentication (2FA) procedure in case of an exceptional event (e.g., a particularly large transaction or a key recovery request). To enable this, the owner of the account secret-shares the answers of some security questions among a committee of users. When the 2FA mechanism is triggered, the committee members can provide the smart contract with enough information to check whether an attempt was successful, and nothing more. We then design a protocol that securely and efficiently implements such a functionality: The protocol is round-optimal, is robust to the corruption of a subset of committee members, supports low-entropy secrets, and is concretely efficient. As a stepping stone towards the design of this protocol, we introduce a new threshold homomorphic encryption scheme for linear predicates from bilinear maps, which might be of independent interest. To substantiate the practicality of our approach, we implement the above protocol as a smart contract in Ethereum and show that it can be used today as an additional safeguard for suspicious transactions, at minimal added cost. We also implement a second scheme where the smart...",

In the real world, businesses take time off, particularly on weekends. This is no different in the crypto-asset world, which, theoretically, is operable 24/7. We also performed a threshold analysis of the flow of bitcoin to identify the big wallets and to compare it with the identity of real-world crypto-exchange companies, in particular, their weekly patterns. Finally, we propose a methodology to identify the financial institution in the bitcoin blockchain on the basis of fulfilling some key criteria. The criteria are having high frequency, appearing persistently on daily big trades and showing a distinct weekly pattern of total average network flow.",

    "abstract": "Internet authentication is critically dependent on Certificate Authorities (CAs), so it is essential to verify the correct operation of CAs. In this context, the initiative known as Certificate Transparency (CT) was created with the objective of facilitating the verification of CAs. In particular, using CT, it is possible to identify any fraudulent certificates issued by CAs. However, the services currently available to perform this identification have already proved to be unreliable, sometimes returning incomplete results. This article presents a tool that implements the Domain Transparency (DT) concept, using verifiable data structures to provide a reliable alternative to these services.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus 2019, called COVID-19, is a transmissible disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It earlier impacted the citizens of China alone. However, it has rapidly spread all over the world. The COVID-19 supply chain system aims to facilitate access to several critical items, such as personal protective equipment (PPE), biomedical equipment, diagnostics supplies, and vaccines. In this article, we discuss a robust security framework for vaccine distribution and tracking in an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)-based cloud-assisted COVID-19 environment by considering both intra-country and inter-country scenarios. Various transactions related to vaccine requests, orders, distribution, and tracking are put into the blockchain in the form of blocks. Since blockchain technology offers immutability, transparency, and decentralization, the security of the proposed framework has been improved significantly. The proposed framework also supports artificial intelligence(AI)-based big data analytics on the information stored into the blocks in the blockchain. Furthermore, a practical demonstration of the proposed framework has been done through a blockchain simulation study.",

There is a promise of abundance at the heart of crypto and we review its brief history with an eye to lessons learned and lessons missed. In this pamphlet we focus on what works in the crypto world, dispelling some myths -– which might annoy some people; we draw lessons and parallels from traditional finance, aspiring to pass on the knowledge and teach the truisms on which our concepts of money rest. The only path forward for crypto today lies within its applications in the financial system. Almost everything else is either misguided ––or too early. Many of the concepts exposed here are truths hiding in plain sight. Our intention is to teach and to show the way to crypto abundance. We are not idle commentators: we are investors, pioneers, leaders, and entrepreneurs in the crypto space, so we have a vested interest in seeing it succeed. While the tone of this pamphlet will be that of analysis and critique, don’t be mistaken: we are overall positive and optimistic about the future of crypto. We would not care otherwise.",

    "abstract": "Scalability has been a bottleneck for major blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Despite the significantly improved scalability claimed by several high-profile blockchain projects, there has been little effort to understand how their transactional throughput is being used. In this paper, we examine recent network traffic of three major high-scalability blockchains---EOSIO, Tezos and XRP Ledger (XRPL)---over a period of seven months. Our analysis reveals that only a small fraction of the transactions are used for value transfer purposes. In particular, 96% of the transactions on EOSIO were triggered by the airdrop of a currently valueless token; on Tezos, 76% of throughput was used for maintaining consensus; and over 94% of transactions on XRPL carried no economic value. We also identify a persisting airdrop on EOSIO as a DoS attack and detect a two-month-long spam attack on XRPL. The paper explores the different designs of the three blockchains and sheds light on how they could shape user behavior.",

There is substantial amount of research on how Boolean functions affect the security of ciphers, and comparatively, little research, on how block cipher wiring can be very special or abnormal. In this article we show a strong type of anomaly: where the complexity of a differential attack does not grow exponentially as the number of rounds increases. It will grow initially, and later will be lower bounded by a constant. At the end of the day the vulnerability is an ordinary single differential attack on the full state. It occurs due to the existence of a hidden polynomial invariant. We conjecture that this type of anomaly is not easily detectable if the attacker has limited resources.",

Known approaches to construct PCD are based on succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (SNARKs) that have a succinct verifier or a succinct accumulation scheme. In this paper we show how to obtain PCD without relying on SNARKs. We construct a PCD scheme given any non-interactive argument of knowledge (e.g., with linear-size arguments) that has a split accumulation scheme, which is a weak form of accumulation that we introduce. Moreover, we construct a transparent non-interactive argument of knowledge for R1CS whose split accumulation is verifiable via a (small) constant number of group and field operations. Our construction is proved secure in the random oracle model based on the hardness of discrete logarithms, and it leads, via the random oracle heuristic and our result above, to concrete efficiency improvements for PCD. Along the way, we construct a split accumulation scheme for Hadamard products under Pedersen commitmentsand for a simple polynomial commitment scheme based on Pedersen commitments. Our results are supported by a modular and efficient implementation.",

We discuss whether this hybrid protocol combining a centralised initiation phase with a decentralised execution phase outperforms fully centralised exchanges with regards to efficiency and security. Here, a fully efficient and fully secure protocol is defined as one where traders incur no trading costs or opportunity costs and counterparty risk is absent. We devise a protocol addressing the main downsides in the decentralised exchange process that uses a facilitating distributed ledger, maintains an order book and monitors the order status in real-time to provide accurate exchange rate information and performance scoring of participants. We show how performance ratings can lower opportunity costs and how a rolling benchmark rate of verifiable trades can be used to establish a trustworthy exchange rate between cryptocurrencies. The formal validation of the proposed technical mechanisms is the subject of future work.",

They allow an attacker, with network access only, to double-spend or lock resources with minimal efforts. The attacker can act independently without colluding with any nodes, and succeed even if all nodes are honest; most of the attacks can also exhibit themselves as faults under periods of asynchrony. These attacks are effective against both shard-led and client-led cross-shard consensus approaches. We present Byzcuit-a new cross-shard consensus protocol that is immune to those attacks. We implement a prototype of Byzcuit and evaluate it on a real cloud-based testbed, showing that our defenses impact performance minimally, and overall performance surpasses previous works.",

    "abstract": "FastPay allows a set of distributed authorities, some of which are Byzantine, to maintain a high-integrity and availability settlement system for pre-funded payments. It can be used to settle payments in a native unit of value (crypto-currency), or as a financial side-infrastructure to support retail payments in fiat currencies. FastPay is based on Byzantine Consistent Broadcast as its core primitive, foregoing the expenses of full atomic commit channels (consensus). The resulting system has low-latency for both confirmation and payment finality. Remarkably, each authority can be sharded across many machines to allow unbounded horizontal scalability. Our experiments demonstrate intra-continental confirmation latency of less than 100ms, making FastPay applicable to point of sale payments. In laboratory environments, we achieve over 80,000 transactions per second with 20 authorities---surpassing the requirements of current retail card payment networks, while significantly increasing their robustness.",

Winkle is a decentralized secondary layer of client-based validation, where a client includes a single additional field into a transaction that they sign: a hash of the previously sequenced block. The block that gets a threshold of signatures (confirmations) weighted by clients' coins is called a \"confirmed\" checkpoint. We show that under plausible and flexible security assumptions about clients the confirmed checkpoints can not be equivocated. We discuss how client key rotation increases security, how to accommodate for coins' minting and how delegation allows for faster checkpoints. We evaluate checkpoint latency experimentally using Bitcoin and Ethereum transaction graphs, with and without delegation of stake.",

    "abstract": "Decentralization powered by blockchain is validated for its capability to build trust like no other computational system before. The evolution of blockchain models has opened new use-cases that are becoming operational in many industry fields such as: energy, healthcare, banking, cross-border trade, aerospace, supply chain, and others. The core component of a decentralized architecture is the consensus algorithm - the set of rules that ensures an automated and fair agreement between the actors in the same network. Classic consensus algorithms are tailored to solve specific problems, but in an open ecosystem, each business case is unique and needs a certain level of customization. This paper introduces a new meta-consensus model called Dynamic Consensus, an architecture extension that allows multiple, complementary, consensus algorithms to run on the same platform. While classic consensus mechanisms are more appropriate for public or private systems (narrow set of rules), a dynamic approach would fit better for federated business consortiums (more rules and higher need for adaptability). The model is illustrated and analyzed as an ongoing experimental feature that can be added to enterprise blockchains designed to operate in cross-domain environments.",

In the last decades, researchers have come up with techniques to generate input data (e.g., fuzzing) and automate the process of generating test cases (e.g., search-based testing). However, these techniques are known to have their own limitations: search-based testing does not generate highly-structured data; grammar-based fuzzing does not generate test case structures. To address these limitations, we combine these two techniques. By applying grammar-based mutations to the input data gathered by the search-based testing algorithm, it allows us to co-evolve both aspects of test case generation. We evaluate our approach, called G-EVOSUITE, by performing an empirical study on 20 Java classes from the three most popular JSON parsers across multiple search budgets. Our results show that the proposed approach on average improves branch coverage for JSON related classes by 15 % (with a maximum increase of 50 %) without negatively impacting other classes.",

    "abstract": "Writing a test case reproducing a reported software crash is a common practice to identify the root cause of an anomaly in the software under test. However, this task is usually labor-intensive and time-taking. Hence, evolutionary intelligence approaches have been successfully applied to assist developers during debugging by generating a test case reproducing reported crashes. These approaches use a single fitness function called Crash Distance to guide the search process toward reproducing a target crash. Despite the reported achievements, these approaches do not always successfully reproduce some crashes due to a lack of test diversity (premature convergence). In this study, we introduce a new approach, called MOHO, that addresses this issue via multi-objectivization. In particular, we introduce two new Helper-Objectives for crash reproduction, namely test length (to minimize) and method sequence diversity (to maximize), in addition to Crash Distance. We assessed MO-HO using five multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (NSGA-II, SPEA2, PESA-II, MOEA/D, FEMO) on 124 non-trivial crashes stemming from open-source projects. Our results indicate that SPEA2 is the best-performing multi-objective algorithm for MO-HO. We evaluated this best-performing algorithm for MO-HO against the state-of-the-art: single-objective approach (Single-Objective Search) and decomposition-based multi-objectivization approach (De-MO). Our results show that MO-HO reproduces five crashes that cannot be reproduced by the current state-of-the-art. Besides, MO-HO improves the effectiveness (+10% and +8% in reproduction ratio) and the efficiency in 34.6% and 36% of crashes (i.e., significantly lower running time) compared to Single-Objective Search and De-MO, respectively. For some crashes, the improvements are very large, being up to +93.3% for reproduction ratio and -92% for the required running time.",

    "abstract": "Automated test case generation tools have been successfully proposed to reduce the amount of human and infrastructure resources required to write and run test cases. However, recent studies demonstrate that the readability of generated tests is very limited due to (i) uninformative identifiers and (ii) lack of proper documentation. Prior studies proposed techniques to improve test readability by either generating natural language summaries or meaningful methods names. While these approaches are shown to improve test readability, they are also affected by two limitations: (1) generated summaries are often perceived as too verbose and redundant by developers, and (2) readable tests require both proper method names but also meaningful identifiers (within-method readability). In this work, we combine template based methods and Deep Learning (DL) approaches to automatically generate test case scenarios (elicited from natural language patterns of test case statements) as well as to train DL models on path-based representations of source code to generate meaningful identifier names. Our approach, called DeepTC-Enhancer, recommends documentation and identifier names with the ultimate goal of enhancing readability of automatically generated test cases. An empirical evaluation with 36 external and internal developers shows that (1) DeepTC-Enhancer outperforms significantly the baseline approach for generating summaries and performs equally with the baseline approach for test case renaming, (2) the transformation proposed by DeepTC-Enhancer results in a significant increase in readability of automatically generated test cases, and (3) there is a significant difference in the feature preferences between external and internal developers.",

    "abstract": "Test smells attempt to capture design issues in test code that reduce their maintainability. Previous work found such smells to be highly common in automatically generated test-cases, but based this result on specific static detection rules; although these are based on the original definition of \"test smells\", a recent empirical study showed that developers perceive these as overly strict and non-representative of the maintainability and quality of test suites. This leads us to investigate how effective such test smell detection tools are on automatically generated test suites. In this paper, we build a dataset of 2,340 test cases automatically generated by EVOSUITE for 100 Java classes. We performed a multi-stage, cross-validated manual analysis to identify six types of test smells and label their instances. We benchmark the performance of two test smell detection tools: one widely used in prior work, and one recently introduced with the express goal to match developer perceptions of test smells. Our results show that these test smell detection strategies poorly characterized the issues in automatically generated test suites; the older tool's detection strategies, especially, misclassified over 70% of test smells, both missing real instances (false negatives) and marking many smell-free tests as smelly (false positives). We identify common patterns in these tests that can be used to improve the tools, refine and update the definition of certain test smells, and highlight as of yet uncharacterized issues. Our findings suggest the need for (i) more appropriate metrics to match development practice; and (ii) more accurate detection strategies, to be evaluated primarily in industrial contexts.",

Developing an optimization scheme that provides high throughput and low latency data transmission can significantly benefit the performance of those systems. This paper investigates the problem of optimizing all-to-all data transmission in a wide area network (WAN) using overlay multicast. We prove that in a hose network model, using shallow tree overlays with height up to two is sufficient for all-to-all data transmission to achieve the optimal throughput allowed by the available network resources. Upon this foundation, we build ShallowForest, a data plane optimization for consensus protocols and blockchain systems. The goal of ShallowForest is to improve consensus protocols' resilience to skewed client load distribution. Experiments with skewed client load across replicas in the Amazon cloud demonstrate that ShallowForest can improve the commit throughput of the EPaxos consensus protocol by up to 100% with up to 60% reduction in commit latency.",

In this paper, we propose one such enhancement that is essential for financial applications and online marketplaces - support for time-based logic such as verifying deadlines or expiry dates and examining a time window of recent account activity. We present a lightweight solution to reach consensus on the current time without relying on external time oracles. Our solution assigns timestamps to blocks at transaction validation time and maintains a cache reflecting the effects of recent transactions. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype, called TimeFabric, in Hyperledger Fabric, a popular permissioned blockchain platform, and experimentally demonstrate high throughput and minimal overhead (approximately 3%) of maintaining trusted time. We also demonstrate a 2x performance improvement due to the cache, compared to reconstructing account histories from the ledger.",

    "abstract": "SMT-based model checkers, especially IC3-style ones, are currently the most effective techniques for verification of infinite state systems. They infer global inductive invariants via local reasoning about a single step of the transition relation of a system, while employing SMT-based procedures, such as interpolation, to mitigate the limitations of local reasoning and allow for better generalization. Unfortunately, these mitigations intertwine model checking with heuristics of the underlying SMT-solver, negatively affecting stability of model checking. In this paper, we propose to tackle the limitations of locality in a systematic manner. We introduce explicit global guidance into the local reasoning performed by IC3-style algorithms. To this end, we extend the SMT-IC3 paradigm with three novel rules, designed to mitigate fundamental sources of failure that stem from locality. We instantiate these rules for the theory of Linear Integer Arithmetic and implement them on top of SPACER solver in Z3. Our empirical results show that GSPACER, SPACER extended with global guidance, is significantly more effective than both SPACER and sole global reasoning, and, furthermore, is insensitive to interpolation.",

    "abstract": "Public blockchains provide integrity, transparency, immutability, and inclusion-guarantee to the transactions they process and record in their chain of blocks. Bitcoin, Litecoin are a few examples of time-tested, reliable public blockchains that handle only one type of transaction i.e., transfer-of-value (specifically money/currency) from a user to another. Whereas, general purpose blockchains like Ethereum provide means and methods to encapsulate transfer of not only a value but any asset class that can be digitally represented. However, due to its high-level programming language to write asset transfer rules, Ethereum has encountered instances where it had to forgo the claim of immutability (e.g., the DAO attack). On contrary, the purpose-built, script-based blockchains like Litecoin have withstood the test of time and therefore are seen as reliable – an important aspect in attracting users to use a system that is built using such proven, reliable protocols. In this paper, we present an asset-transfer system for land management that borrows from Litecoin protocol its script, underlying consensus and block structure. Our resultant system is a permissioned blockchain, where only a set of pre-approved miners can append land records to the blockchain. We integrate sidechains to store transaction details that are private to the transacting parties, thus providing conditional privacy to the transactions. The mainchain stores land records that can be queried by the public, whereas sidechains are integrated to store the intricate details about the intermediate validations/operations performed by regulators, registrars, and notaries.",

    "abstract": "There has been significant interest in leveraging limited look-ahead to achieve low competitive ratios for online convex optimization (OCO). However, existing online algorithms (such as Averaging Fixed Horizon Control (AFHC)) that can leverage look-ahead to reduce the competitive ratios still produce competitive ratios that grow unbounded as the coefficient ratio (i.e., the maximum ratio of the switching-cost coefficient and the service-cost coefficient) increases. On the other hand, the regularization method can attain a competitive ratio that remains bounded when the coefficient ratio is large, but it does not benefit from look-ahead. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, called Regularization with Look-Ahead (RLA), that can get the best of both AFHC and the regularization method, i.e., its competitive ratio decreases with the look-ahead window size when the coefficient ratio is small, and remains bounded when the coefficient ratio is large. We also provide a matching lower bound for the competitive ratios of all online algorithms with look-ahead, which differs from the achievable competitive ratio of RLA by a factor that only depends on the problem size. The competitive analysis of RLA involves a non-trivial generalization of online primal-dual analysis to the case with look-ahead.",

To address this problem, we propose a generic framework to reduce the noise level of training data for the training of any machine learning-based Android malware detection. Our framework makes use of all intermediate states of two identical deep learning classification models during their training with a given noisy training dataset and generate a noise-detection feature vector for each input sample. Our framework then applies a set of outlier detection algorithms on all noise-detection feature vectors to reduce the noise level of the given training data before feeding it to any machine learning based Android malware detection approach. In our experiments with three different Android malware detection approaches, our framework can detect significant portions of wrong labels in different training datasets at different noise ratios, and improve the performance of Android malware detection approaches.",

It allows a party to create a transaction associated with an access policy, while another party who possesses enough rewriting privileges satisfying the access policy can rewrite the transaction. However, it lacks accountability. The chameleon trapdoor holder may abuse his/her rewriting privilege and maliciously rewrite the hashed object in the transaction without being identified. In this paper, we introduce policy-based chameleon hash with black-box accountability (PCHBA). Black-box accountability allows an attribute authority to link modified transactions to responsible transaction modifiers in case of dispute, in which any public user identifies those transaction modifiers from interacting with an access device/blackbox. We first present a generic framework of PCHBA. Then, we present a practical instantiation, showing its practicality through implementation and evaluation analysis.",

Existing platforms do not provide flexible and practical access control mechanisms for big data analytics applications. In this paper, we present GuardSpark++, a fine-grained access control mechanism for secure data sharing and analysis in Spark. In particular, we first propose a purpose-aware access control (PAAC) model, which introduces new concepts of data processing/operation purposes to conventional purpose-based access control. An automatic purpose analysis algorithm is developed to identify purposes from data analytics operations and queries, so that access control could be enforced accordingly. Moreover, we develop an access control mechanism in Spark Catalyst, which provides unified PAAC enforcement for heterogeneous data sources and upper-layer applications. We evaluate GuardSpark++ with five data sources and four structured data analytics engines in Spark. The experimental results show that GuardSpark++ provides effective access control functionalities with a very small performance overhead (average 3.97%).",

    "abstract": "We examined the authentication procedures used by five prepaid wireless carriers when a customer attempted to change their SIM card. These procedures are an important line of defense against attackers who seek to hijack victims’ phone numbers by posing as the victim and calling the carrier to request that service be transferred to a SIM card the attacker possesses. We found that all five carriers used insecure authentication challenges that could be easily subverted by attackers. We also found that attackers generally only needed to target the most vulnerable authentication challenges, because the rest could be bypassed. Authentication of SIM swap requests presents a classic usability-security trade-off, with carriers underemphasizing security. In an anecdotal evaluation of postpaid accounts at three carriers, presented in Appendix A, we also found—very tentatively—that some carriers may have implemented stronger authentication for postpaid accounts than for prepaid accounts. To quantify the downstream effects of these vulnerabilities, we reverse-engineered the authentication policies of over 140 websites that offer phone-based authentication. We rated the level of vulnerability of users of each website to a SIM swap attack, and have released our findings as an annotated dataset on issms2fasecure.com. Notably, we found 17 websites on which user accounts can be compromised based on a SIM swap alone, i.e., without a password compromise. We encountered failures in vulnerability disclosure processes that resulted in these vulnerabilities remaining unfixed by nine of the 17 companies despite our responsible disclosure. Finally, we analyzed enterprise MFA solutions from three vendors, finding that two of them give users inadequate control over the security-usability tradeoff.",

Since their inception, several innovative projects have been proposing solutions to the blockchain trilemma, improving blockchain features and its technical limitations. However, the adoption of blockchain as a technology or a software component, requires a comprehensive understanding and characterization of their technical principles and characteristics. The latter introduces an uncertainty for an organization to decide which blockchain protocol best meets its needs and demands. In general, there is a lack of proper testing and software engineering practices for assessing the usage of blockchains usage and understanding their performance. Towards that direction, this paper presents an architecture for a blockchain benchmarking framework which aims at the deployment and evaluation of different blockchain protocols, focusing on different aspects such as security and scalability. A set of modules is introduced for testing and evaluating the behaviour of blockchain protocols under different test scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The Raft consensus algorithm constitutes a widely-used algorithm not only in the broader area of distributed systems, ut also in private/permissioned blockchains such as Hyperledger Fabric. A Raft-based distributed system (RDS) strongly relies on leader election, which involves a number of time-related parameters. In the Raft-related literature, the process according to which those parameters are set is an under-researched area. Specifically, the use of the uniform distribution is the dominant approach. Motivated by this realization, in this work, we focus on these time parameters proposing the notion of “leadership uniformity” in combination with a series of performance metrics. Leadership uniformity is based on the desirable characteristic of having equality among the nodes who serve as leaders. The proposed performance metrics are straightforward adaptations of widely-used measurements from broad disciplines such as estimation theory. The experimental results of this work justify the appropriateness of the proposed notion of leadership uniformity. Specifically, the best performance was yielded by the utilization of normal distribution from which the time parameters under investigation were drawn.",

    "abstract": "The disastrous vulnerabilities in smart contracts sharply remind us of our ignorance: we do not know how to write code that is secure in composition with malicious code. Information flow control has long been proposed as a way to achieve compositional security, offering strong guarantees even when combining software from different trust domains. Unfortunately, this appealing story breaks down in the presence of reentrancy attacks. We formalize a general definition of reentrancy and introduce a security condition that allows software modules like smart contracts to protect their key invariants while retaining the expressive power of safe forms of reentrancy. We present a security type system that provably enforces secure information flow; in conjunction with run-time mechanisms, it enforces secure reentrancy even in the presence of unknown code; and it helps locate and correct recent high-profile vulnerabilities.",

For this purpose, we collected and analyzed detailed data on 107 different blockchain technologies and studied their component-wise technological evolution. The diversity of their designs was captured by deconstructing the blockchains using the Tasca-Tessone taxonomy to build what we call the “tree of blockchain” composed of blockchain main and sub-components. With the support of information theory and phylogenetics, we found that most design explorations have been conducted within the components in the areas of consensus mechanisms and cryptographic primitives. We also show that some sub-components like Consensus Immutability and Failure Tolerance, Access and Control layer, and Access Supply Management have predictive power over other sub-components. We finally found that few dominant design models—the genetic driving clusters of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP—influenced the evolutionary paths of most of the succeeding blockchains.",

In this paper, we estimate the lower bound for the global mining energy cost for a period of 10 years from 2010 to 2020, taking into account changes in energy costs, improvements in hashing technologies and hashing activity. We estimate energy cost for Bitcoin mining using two methods: Brent Crude oil prices as a global standard and regional industrial electricity prices weighted by the share of hashing activity. Despite a 10-billion-fold increase in hashing activity and a 10-million-fold increase in total energy consumption, we find the cost relative to the volume of transactions has not increased nor decreased since 2010. This is consistent with the perspective that, in order to keep the Blockchain system secure from double spending attacks, the proof or work must cost a sizable fraction of the value that can be transferred through the network. We estimate that in the Bitcoin network this fraction is of the order of 1%.",

A systematic and data-driven analysis, comparison and rigorous evaluation of the different design choices of distributed ledgers and their implications is a challenge. The rapidly evolving nature of the blockchain landscape hinders reaching a common understanding of the techno-socio-economic design space of distributed ledgers and the cryptoeconomies they support. To fill this gap, this paper makes the following contributions: (i) A conceptual architecture of DLT systems with which (ii) a taxonomy is designed and (iii) a rigorous classification of DLT systems is made using real-world data and wisdom of the crowd. (iv) A DLT design guideline is the end result of applying machine learning methodologies on the classification data. Compared to related work and as defined in earlier taxonomy theory, the proposed taxonomy is highly comprehensive, robust, explanatory and extensible. The findings of this paper can provide new insights and better understanding of the key design choices evolving the modeling complexity of DLT systems, while identifying opportunities for new research contributions and business innovation.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology has been envisaged to commence an era of decentralised applications and services (DApps) without the need for a trusted intermediary. Such DApps open a marketplace in which services are delivered to end-users by contributors which are then incentivised by cryptocurrencies in an automated, peer-to-peer, and trustless fashion. However, blockchain, consolidated by smart contracts, only ensures on-chain data security, autonomy and integrity of the business logic execution defined in smart contracts. It cannot guarantee the quality of service of DApps, which entirely depends on the services’ performance. Thus, there is a critical need for a trust system to reduce the risk of dealing with fraudulent counterparts in a blockchain network. These reasons motivate us to develop a fully decentralised trust framework deployed on top of a blockchain platform, operating along with DApps in the marketplace to demoralise deceptive entities while encouraging trustworthy ones. The trust system works as an underlying decentralised service providing a feedback mechanism for end-users and maintaining trust relationships among them in the ecosystem accordingly. We believe this research fortifies the DApps ecosystem by introducing an universal trust middleware for DApps as well as shedding light on the implementation of a decentralised trust system.",

    "abstract": "Classical cryptographic schemes in use today are based on the difficulty of certain number theoretic problems. Security is guaranteed by the fact that the computational work required to break the core mechanisms of these schemes on a conventional computer is infeasible; however, the difficulty of these problems would not withstand the computational power of a large-scale quantum computer. To this end, the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization process initiated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is well underway. In addition to the evaluation criteria provided by NIST, the energy consumption of these candidate algorithms is also an important criterion to consider due to the use of battery-operated devices, high-performance computing environments where energy costs are critical, as well as in the interest of green computing. In this paper, the energy consumption of PQC candidates is evaluated on an Intel Core i7-6700 CPU using PAPI, the Performance API. The energy measurements are categorized based on their proposed security level and cryptographic functionality. The results are then further subdivided based on the underlying mechanism used in order to identify the most energy-efficient schemes. Lastly, IgProf is used to identify the most energy-consuming subroutines within a select number of submissions to highlight potential areas for optimization.",

    "abstract": "The blockchain paradigm provides a mechanism for content dissemination and distributed consensus on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. While this paradigm has been widely adopted in industry, it has not been carefully analyzed in terms of its network scaling with respect to the number of peers. Applications for blockchain systems, such as cryptocurrencies and IoT, require this form of network scaling. In this paper, we propose a new stochastic network model for a blockchain system. We identify a structural property called one-endedness, which we show to be desirable in any blockchain system as it is directly related to distributed consensus among the peers. We show that the stochastic stability of the network is sufficient for the one-endedness of a blockchain. We further establish that our model belongs to a class of network models, called monotone separable models. This allows us to establish upper and lower bounds on the stability region. The bounds on stability depend on the connectivity of the P2P network through its conductance and allow us to analyze the scalability of blockchain systems on large P2P networks. We verify our theoretical insights using both synthetic data and real data from the Bitcoin network.",

    "abstract": "Network operators compose Service Function Chains (SFCs) by tying different network functions (e.g., packet inspection, flow shaping, network address translation) together and process traffic flows in the order the network functions are chained. Leveraging the technique of Network Function Virtualization (NFV), each network function can be “virtualized” and decoupled from its dedicated hardware, and therefore can be deployed flexibly for better performance at any appropriate location of the underlying network infrastructure. However, an SFC often incurs high latency as traffic goes through the virtual network functions one after another. In this article, we first design an algorithm that leverages virtual network function dependency to convert an original SFC into a parallelized SFC (p-SFC). Then, to deploy multiple p-SFCs over the network for serving a large number of users, we model the deployment problem as an Integer Linear Program and propose a heuristic, ParaSFC, based on the Viterbi dynamic programming algorithm to estimate each p-SFC's occupation of the bottleneck resources and adjust the processing order of the p-SFCs in order to approximate the optimal solution. Finally, we conduct extensive trace-driven evaluations and exhibit that, compared to the Greedy method and the state-of-the-art CoordVNF method, ParaSFC reduces the average service latency of all the deployed p-SFCs by about 15 percent through parallelization while accommodating more SFC deployment requests over resource-limited networks.",

    "abstract": "Edge computing is emerging as a promising computing paradigm for supporting next-generation applications that rely on low-latency network connections in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era. Many edge applications, such as multi-player augmented reality (AR) gaming and federated machine learning, require that distributed clients work collaboratively for a common goal through message exchanges. Given an edge network, it is an open problem how to deploy such collaborative edge applications to achieve the best overall system performance. This paper presents a formal study of this problem. We first provide a mix of cost models to capture the system. Based on a thorough formulation, we propose an iterative algorithm dubbed ITEM, where in each iteration, we construct a graph to encode all the costs and convert the cost optimization problem into a graph cut problem. By obtaining the minimum s-t cut via existing max-flow algorithms, we address the original problem via solving a series of graph cuts. We rigorously prove that ITEM has a parameterized constant approximation ratio. Inspired by the optimal stopping theory, we further design an online algorithm called OPTS, based on optimally alternating between partial and full placement updates. Our evaluations with real-world data traces demonstrate that ITEM performs close to the optimum (within 5%) and converges fast. OPTS achieves a bounded performance as expected while reducing full updates by more than 67% of the time.",

    "abstract": "The computing frontier is moving from centralized mega datacenters towards distributed cloudlets at the network edge. We argue that cloudlets are well-suited for handling power demand response to help the grid maintain stability due to more flexible workload management attributed to their distributed nature. However, they also require computing demand response to avoid overload and maintain reliability. To this end, we propose a novel online market mechanism, EdgeDR, to achieve cost efficiency in edge demand response programs. At a high level, we observe that the cloudlet operator can dynamically switch on/off entire cloudlets to compensate for the energy reduction required by the power grid or provide enough computing resources to the edge service. We formulate a long-term social cost minimization problem and decompose it into a series of one-round procurement auctions. In each auction instance, we propose to let the cloudlet tenants bid with cost functions of their two-dimension service quality degradation tolerance, and let the cloudlet operator choose the service quality, manage the workload, and schedule the cloudlets activation status. In addition, we present a dynamic payment mechanism for the operator to balance the tradeoff between short-term profit and long-term benefit in more practical scenarios. Via rigorous analysis, we exhibit that our bidding policy is individually rational and truthful; our workload management algorithm has near-optimal performance in each auction; and our overall online algorithm achieves a provable competitive ratio. We further confirm the performance of our mechanism through extensive trace-driven simulations.",

    "abstract": "Efficiently analyzing geo-distributed datasets is emerging as a major demand in a cloud-edge system. Since the datasets are often generated in closer proximity to end users, traditional works mainly focus on offloading proper tasks from those hotspot edges to the datacenter to decrease the overall completion time of submitted jobs in a one-shot manner. However, optimizing the completion time of current job alone is insufficient in a long-term scope since some datasets would be used multiple times. Instead, optimizing the data distribution is much more efficient and could directly benefit forthcoming jobs, although it may postpone the execution of current one. Unfortunately, due to the throwaway feature of data fetcher, existing data analytics systems fail to re-distribute corresponding data out of hotspot edges after the execution of data analytics. In order to minimize the overall completion time for a sequence of jobs as well as to guarantee the performance of current one, we propose to re-distribute the data along with task offloading, and formulate corresponding ε -bounded data-driven task scheduling problem over wide area network under the consideration of edge heterogeneity. We design an online schema run Data, which offloads proper tasks and related data via piggybacking to the datacenter based on delicately calculated probabilities. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, run Data is proved concentrated on its optimum with high probability. We implement run Data based on Spark and HDFS. Both testbed results and trace-driven simulations show that run Data re-distributes proper data via piggybacking and achieves up to 37 percent reduction on average response time compared with state-of-the-art schemas.",

However, most existing password entry schemes on smart glasses rely on additional computers or mobile devices connected to smart glasses, which require users to switch between different systems and devices. This may greatly lower the practicability and usability of smart glasses. In this paper, we focus on this challenge and design three practical anti-eavesdropping password entry schemes on stand-alone smart glasses, named gTapper, gRotator and gTalker. The main idea is to break the correlation between the underlying password and the interaction observable to adversaries. In our IRB-approved user study, these schemes are found to be easy-to-use without additional hardware under various test conditions, where the participants can enter their passwords within moderate time, at high accuracy, and in various situations.",

    "abstract": "A novel slow-aging solution named SDAC is proposed to address the model aging problem in Android malware detection, which is due to the lack of adapting to the changes in Android specifications during malware detection. Different from periodic retraining of detection models in existing solutions, SDAC evolves effectively by evaluating new APIs' contributions to malware detection according to existing API's contributions. In SDAC, the contributions of APIs are evaluated by their contexts in the API call sequences extracted from Android apps. A neural network is applied on the sequences to assign APIs to vectors, among which the differences of API vectors are regarded as the semantic distances. SDAC then clusters all APIs based on their semantic distances to create a feature set in the training phase, and extends the feature set to include all new APIs in the detecting phase. Without being trained by any new set of real-labelled apps, SDAC can adapt to the changes in Android specifications by simply identifying new APIs appearing in the detection phase. In extensive experiments with datasets dated from 2011 to 2016, SDAC achieves a significantly higher accuracy and a significantly slower aging speed compared with MaMaDroid, a state-of-the-art Android malware detection solution which maintains resilience to API changes.",

    "abstract": "Cloud-fog computing is a novel paradigm to extend the functionality of cloud computing for providing a variety of on-demand data services via the edge network. Many cryptographic tools have been introduced to preserve data confidentiality against the untrustworthy network and cloud servers. However, how to efficiently identify and retrieve useful data from a large number of ciphertexts without a costly decryption mechanism remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we introduce a cloud-fog-device data sharing system (CFDS) with data confidentiality and data source identification simultaneously based on a new cryptographic primitive named matchmaking attribute-based encryption (MABE) by extending matchmaking encryption in CRYPTO'19. Our solution offers a secure fine-grained bilateral access control that includes (1) fine-grained sender access control; (2) fine-grained receiver access control; (3) sender privacy; and (4) performance optimization via outsourcing data source identification to fog nodes. We give the formal definition and security models of MABE, and present a concrete construction with formal security proofs. We also offer a detailed security analysis of our proposed CFDS against real-world security threats. The extensive comparison and experimental simulation demonstrate that, by immigrating heavy workload to fog nodes, our scheme has better functionalities and performances than the most related solutions.",

In recent years, much effort has been made to evaluate the password strength or to generate strong passwords. Unfortunately, the usability or memorability of the strong passwords has been largely neglected. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between strong password generation and the usability of strong passwords. We propose to automatically generate textual password mnemonics, i.e., natural language sentences, which are intended to help users better memorize passwords. We introduce DeepMnemonic, a deep attentive encoder-decoder framework which takes a password as input and then automatically generates a mnemonic sentence for the password. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate DeepMnemonic on the real-world data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that DeepMnemonic outperforms a well-known baseline for generating semantically meaningful mnemonic sentences. Moreover, the user study further validates that the generated mnemonic sentences by DeepMnemonic are useful in helping users memorize strong passwords.",

    "abstract": "Data authentication primarily serves as a tool to achieve data integrity and source authentication. However, traditional data authentication does not fit well where an intermediate entity (editor) is required to modify the authenticated data provided by the source/data owner before sending the data to other recipients. To ask the data owner for authenticating each modified data can lead to higher communication overhead. In this article, we introduce the notion of editing-enabled signatures where the data owner can choose any set of modification operations applicable on the data and still can restrict any possibly untrusted editor to authenticate the data modified using an operation from this set only. Moreover, the editor does not need to interact with the data owner in order to authenticate the data every time it is modified. We construct an editing-enabled signature (EES) scheme that derives its efficiency from mostly lightweight cryptographic primitives. We formalize the security model for editing-enabled signatures and analyze the security of our EES scheme. Editing-enabled signatures can find numerous applications that involve generic editing tasks and privacy-preserving operations. We demonstrate how our EES scheme can be applied in two privacy-preserving applications.",

    "abstract": "The end-users communicating over a network path currently have no control over the path. For a better quality of service, the source node often opts for a superior (or premium) network path to send packets to the destination node. However, the current Internet architecture provides no assurance that the packets indeed follow the designated path. Network path validation schemes address this issue and enable each node present on a network path to validate whether each packet has followed the specific path so far. In this work, we introduce two notions of privacy—path privacy and index privacy—in the context of network path validation. We show that, in case a network path validation scheme does not satisfy these two properties, the scheme is vulnerable to certain practical attacks (that affect the privacy, reliability, neutrality and quality of service offered by the underlying network). To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work that addresses privacy issues related to network path validation. We design PrivNPV, a privacy-preserving network path validation protocol, that satisfies both path privacy and index privacy. We discuss several attacks related to network path validation and how PrivNPV defends against these attacks. Finally, we discuss the practicality of PrivNPV based on relevant parameters.",

In this paper, we propose a Lightweight Sharable and Traceable (LiST) secure mobile health system in which patient data are encrypted end-to-end from a patient's mobile device to data users. LiST enables efficient keyword search and fine-grained access control of encrypted data, supports tracing of traitors who sell their search and access privileges for monetary gain, and allows on-demand user revocation. LiST is lightweight in the sense that it offloads most of the heavy cryptographic computations to the cloud while only lightweight operations are performed at the end user devices. We formally define the security of LiST and prove that it is secure without random oracle. We also conduct extensive experiments to access the system's performance.",

Leakage attacks, such as side channel attacks, have been extensively modelled and studied in the literature. However, to the best of our knowledge, leakage attacks to biometric-based remote user authentication with fuzzy extractors have never been studied rigorously. In this paper, we propose a generic framework of leakage-resilient and privacy-preserving biometric-based remote user authentication that allows an authorized user to securely authenticate herself to a remote authentication server using her biometrics. In particular, the authorized user relies only on her secret biometrics to perform a valid authentication — which is suitable for user authentications in a cross-platform setting.",

    "abstract": "Although Bitcoin was intended to be a decentralized digital currency, in practice, mining power is quite concentrated. This fact is a persistent source of concern for the Bitcoin community. We provide an explanation using a simple model to capture miners' incentives to invest in equipment. In our model, n miners compete for a prize of fixed size. Each miner chooses an investment qi, incurring cost ciqi, and then receives reward qαi∑jqαj, for some α≥1. When ci=cj for all i,j, and α=1, there is a unique equilibrium where all miners invest equally. However, we prove that under seemingly mild deviations from this model, equilibrium outcomes become drastically more centralized. In particular, (a) When costs are asymmetric, if miner i chooses to invest, then miner j has market share at least 1−cjci. That is, if miner j has costs that are (e.g.) 20% lower than those of miner i, then miner j must control at least 20% of the \\emph{total} mining power. (b) In the presence of economies of scale (α>1), every market participant has a market share of at least 1−1α, implying that the market features at most αα−1 miners in total. We discuss the implications of our results for the future design of cryptocurrencies. In particular, our work further motivates the study of protocols that minimize \"orphaned\" blocks, proof-of-stake protocols, and incentive compatible protocols.",

    "abstract": "The inception of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer payment system, and its underlying blockchain data-structure and protocol, has led to an increased interest in deploying scalable and reliable distributed-ledger systems that build on robust consensus protocols. A critical requirement of such systems is to provide enough fault tolerance in the presence of adversarial attacks or network faults. This is essential to guarantee liveness when the network does not behave as expected and ensure that the underlying nodes agree on a unique order of transactions over a shared state. In comparison with traditional distributed systems, the deployment of a distributed-ledger system should take into account the hidden game theoretical aspects of such protocols, where actors are competing with each other in an environment which is likely to experience various well-motivated malicious and adversarial attacks. Firstly, this paper discusses the fundamental principles of existing consensus protocols in the context of both permissioned and permissionless distributed-ledger systems. The main contribution of this work deals with observations from experimenting with Ripple’s consensus protocol as it is embodied in the XRP Ledger. The main experimental finding suggests that, when a low percentage of malicious nodes is present, the centralization degree of the network can be significantly relaxed ensuring low convergence times. Those findings are of particular importance when engineering a consensus algorithm that would like to balance security with decentralization.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain has become a promising technology in distributed systems in recent years, but scalability remains a major problem. The traditional approach to scalability, namely sharding, does not solve the problem easily because the process of interleaving blocks stored in different shards to create a unified master ledger introduces overhead. This paper examines two techniques for interleaving the shards of permissioned blockchains, which we refer to as strong temporal coupling and weak temporal coupling. We implement these techniques in a prototype system with a Bitcoin-like transaction structure, using the EPaxos consensus protocol for transaction ordering. Our experimental results show that strong coupling can achieve lower latency as compared to weak coupling but same level of peak throughput. However, strong coupling requires all shards to grow at the same rate, and cannot tolerate any shard failure. In contrast, the higher latency of weak coupling is because of the consensus strategy it uses to order the blocks. However, if shard failure occurs, weak coupling can still make progress without stalling the whole system.",

Crucially, the system allows participants to establish and use multiple unlinked identities for communication with each other. The architecture leverages ordinary SMTP for message delivery and Tor for peer-to-peer communication. The design offers a robust, unintrusive method to use self-certifying Tor onion service names to bootstrap a web of trust based on public keys for end-to-end authentication and encryption, which in turn can be used to facilitate message delivery when the sender and recipient are not online simultaneously. We show how the system can interoperate with existing email systems and paradigms, allowing users to hold messages that others can retrieve via IMAP or to operate as a relay between system participants and external email users. Finally, we show how it is possible to use a broadcast protocol to implement mailing lists and how distributed ledger technology might be used to bootstrap consensus about shared knowledge among list members.",

    "abstract": "To achieve interoperability between unconnected ledgers, hash time lock contracts (HTLCs) are commonly used for cross-chain asset exchange. The solution tolerates transaction failure, and can \"make the best out of worst\" by allowing transacting agents to at least keep their original assets in case of an abort. Nonetheless, as an undesired outcome, reoccurring transaction failures prompt a critical and analytical examination of the protocol. In this study, we propose a game-theoretic framework to study the strategic behaviors of agents taking part in cross-chain atomic swaps implemented with HTLCs. We study the success rate of the transaction as a function of the exchange rate of the swap, the token price and its volatility, among other variables. We demonstrate that in an attempt to maximize one's own utility as asset price changes, either agent might withdraw from the swap. An extension of our model confirms that collateral deposits can improve the transaction success rate, motivating further research towards collateralization without a trusted third party. A second model variation suggests that a swap is more likely to succeed when agents dynamically adjust the exchange rate in response to price fluctuations.",

To this end, we design and evaluate a mempool protocol, Narwhal, specializing in high-throughput reliable dissemination and storage of causal histories of transactions. Narwhal tolerates an asynchronous network and maintains its performance despite failures. We demonstrate that composing \\Narwhal with a partially synchronous consensus protocol (HotStuff) yields significantly better throughput even in the presence of faults. However, loss of liveness during view-changes can result in high latency. To achieve overall good performance when faults occur we propose Tusk, a zero-message overhead asynchronous consensus protocol embedded within Narwhal. We demonstrate its high performance under a variety of configurations and faults. Further, Narwhal is designed to easily scale-out using multiple workers at each validator, and we demonstrate that there is no foreseeable limit to the throughput we can achieve for consensus, with a few seconds latency. As a summary of results, on a Wide Area Network (WAN), Hotstuff over Narwhal achieves 170,000 tx/sec with a 2.5-sec latency instead of 1,800 tx/sec with 1-sec latency of Hotstuff. Additional workers increase throughput linearly to 600,000 tx/sec without any latency increase. Tusk achieves 140,000 tx/sec with 4 seconds latency or 20x better than the state-of-the-art asynchronous protocol. Under faults, both Narwhal based protocols maintain high throughput, but the HotStuff variant suffers from slightly higher latency.",

Is this sort of attack also possible for DES? We present a simple proof of concept attack on DES where a product of 5 polynomials is an invariant for 2 rounds of DES. Furthermore we present numerous additional examples of invariants with higher degrees. We analyse the success probability when the Boolean functions are chosen at random and compare to DES S-boxes. For more complex higher degree attacks the difficulties disappear progressively and up to 100 % of all Boolean functions in 6 variables are potentially vulnerable. A major limitation for all our attacks, is that they work only for a fraction of the key space. However in some cases, this fraction of the key space is very large for the full 16-round DES.",

The goal is to evaluate how the quality of an inference for a network feature degrades when the assumed model is misspecified. Decision theory methods aimed to identify model missespecification are applied in the context of network data with the goal of investigating the stability of optimal actions to perturbations to the assumed model. Here the modified versions of the model are contained within a well defined neighborhood of model space. Our main challenge is to combine stochastic optimization and graph limits tools to explore the model space. As a result, a method for robustness on exchangeable random networks is developed. Our approach is inspired by recent developments in the context of robustness and recent works in the robust control, macroeconomics and financial mathematics literature and more specifically and is based on the concept of graphon approximation through its empirical graphon.",

These P2P technologies are able to securely diffuse information within and across networks, without need for trustees or central authorities to enforce consensus. In this contribution, we propose a minimalistic stochastic model to understand the dynamics of blockchain-based consensus. By leveraging on random-walk theory, we model block propagation delay on different network topologies and provide a classification of blockchain systems in terms of two emergent properties. Firstly, we identify two performing regimes: a functional regime corresponding to an optimal system function; and a non-functional regime characterised by a congested or branched state of sub-optimal blockchains. Secondly, we discover a phase transition during the emergence of consensus and numerically investigate the corresponding critical point. Our results provide important insights into the consensus mechanism and sub-optimal states in decentralised systems.",

    "abstract": "Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) systems have seen extensive study for more than two decades, yet we lack a principled strategy for testing BFT implementations. This paper presents Twins, a new approach for testing BFT systems. The main idea of Twins is that we can emulate Byzantine behavior by running two (or generally up to k) instances of a node with the same identity. Each of the two instances (or Twins) runs unmodified, correct code. The Twins approach requires only a thin network wrapper that delivers messages to/from both Twins. To the rest of the system, the Twins appear indistinguishable from a single node behaving in a `questionable' manner. Twins generates `interesting' Byzantine behaviors, including equivocation, double voting, and losing internal state, while forgoing `uninteresting' behaviors that are trivially rejected by honest nodes, such as producing semantically invalid messages. Building on this idea, Twins can systematically generate Byzantine attack scenarios at scale, execute them in a controlled manner, and check for desired protocol properties. The paper demonstrates that Twins successfully reinstates several famous attacks on BFT protocols. In all cases, protocols break within fewer than a dozen protocol steps, hence it is realistic for the Twins approach to expose the problems. In two of these attacks, it took the community more than a decade to discover protocol flaws that Twins would have surfaced within minutes. Additionally, Twins testing was successfully incorporated into a production setting in which Twins executed 3M Twins-generated scenarios, and exposed (self-injected) subtle safety bugs within minutes of testing.",

Specifically, we construct a zero-knowledge IOP where, for the satisfiability of an N-gate arithmetic circuit over any field of size Ω(N), the prover uses O(N) field operations and the verifier uses polylog(N) field operations (with proof length O(N) and query complexity polylog(N)).

    "abstract": "A polynomial commitment scheme (PCS) provides the ability to commit to a polynomial over a finite field and prove its evaluation at points. A succinct PCS has commitment and evaluation proof size sublinear in the degree of the polynomial. An efficient PCS has sublinear proof verification. Recently, it has been shown that any efficient and succinct PCS can be used to construct a SNARK with similar security and efficiency characteristics. We define an additive PCS to capture a ``homomorphic\" property of commitments over a computational group G of bounded size. All existing examples of additive schemes (e.g., Bulletproofs, KZG, DARK, Dory) are also what we call m-spanning, meaning that commitments to the monomials of degree less than m generate G. Our first technical result is a black-box transformation of any m-spanning additive PCS into a hiding PCS with a zero-knowledge evaluation proof. Our second technical result is that every additive succinct PCS supports efficient proof aggregation. PCS proof aggregation reduces the task of proving evaluations of multiple commitments at multiple independent points to the task of proving the evaluation of a single ``aggregate\" commitment at a single point. We present two flavors of aggregation: private and public. In private aggregation the prover has a private witness consisting of openings of the input commitments. In public aggregation, the prover/verifier share the same inputs, which includes non-interactive evaluation proofs for each input commitment. Our public aggregation protocol applies to any additive succinct PCS. Our private aggregation protocol applies more broadly to any succinct PCS that supports an efficient linear combination scheme: a protocol for verifiably aggregating commitments into a new commitment to their linear combination. This includes non-additive schemes such as the post-quantum FRI-based PCS. We apply these results to the Halo proof carrying data (PCD) system. Halo was originally built using the Bulletproofs inner-product argument as the underlying PCS, and was recently generalized to work with the KZG PCS. We show that Halo can be instantiated with any PCS that supports efficient PCS aggregation, private or public. Thus, our results show that efficient (zero-knowledge) SNARKs and PCD can be constructed from any succinct PCS that has an efficient linear combination scheme, even if the PCS itself is inefficient. These results yield new Halo-like PCD systems from PCS constructions beyond Bulletproofs and KZG, including DARK, FRI, and Dory. The post-quantum Halo instantiation from FRI is particularly surprising as FRI is not additive.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies zero-knowledge SNARKs for NP, where the prover incurs O(N) finite field operations to prove the satisfiability of an N-sized R1CS instance. We observe that recent work of Bootle, Chiesa, and Groth (BCG, TCC 20) provides a polynomial commitment scheme that, when combined with the linear-time interactive proof system of Spartan~(CRYPTO 20), yields linear-time IOPs and SNARKs for R1CS. Specifically, for security parameter λ, and for an N-sized R1CS instance over a field of size exp(λ) and fixed ϵ>0, the prover incurs O(N) finite field operations to produce a proof of size Oλ(Nϵ) that can be verified in Oλ(Nϵ)---after a one-time preprocessing step, which requires O(N) finite field operations. This reestablishes the main result of BCG. Arguably, our approach is conceptually simpler and more direct. Additionally, the polynomial commitment scheme that we distill from BCG is of independent interest; it improves over the prior state of the art by offering the first scheme where the time to commit to an N-sized polynomial is O(N) finite field operations. We further observe that one can render the aforementioned SNARK zero knowledge and reduce the proof size and verifier time to polylogarithmic---while maintaining a linear-time prover---by outsourcing the verifier's work via one layer of proof composition with an existing zkSNARK as the ``outer'' proof system. A similar result can be derived from recent work of Bootle, Chiesa, and Liu (ePrint 2020/1527). We implement the aforementioned polynomial commitment scheme with ϵ=1/2 and combine it with Spartan’s interactive proof system to obtain a SNARK for R1CS. We refer to this combination as Cerberus. It uses Reed-Solomon codes in the polynomial commitment scheme, and hence the prover is not asymptotically linear-time. Nonetheless, Cerberus features the fastest known prover (the only exception is Spartan when proving large instances over 256-bit fields), and is plausibly post-quantum secure.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel distributed monetary system called Hearsay that tolerates both Byzantine and rational behavior without the need for agents to reach consensus on executed transactions. Recent work [5, 10, 15] has shown that distributed monetary systems do not require consensus and can operate using a broadcast primitive with weaker guarantees, such as reliable broadcast. However, these protocols assume that some number of agents may be Byzantine and the remaining agents are perfectly correct. For the application of a monetary system in which the agents are real people with economic interests, the assumption that agents are perfectly correct may be too strong. We expand upon this line of thought by weakening the assumption of correctness and instead adopting a fault tolerance model which allows up to t<N3 agents to be Byzantine and the remaining agents to be rational. A rational agent is one which will deviate from the protocol if it is in their own best interest. Under this fault tolerance model, Hearsay implements a monetary system in which all rational agents achieve agreement on executed transactions. Moreover, Hearsay requires only a single broadcast per transaction. In order to incentivize rational agents to behave correctly in Hearsay, agents are rewarded with transaction fees for participation in the protocol and punished for noticeable deviations from the protocol. Additionally, Hearsay uses a novel broadcast primitive called Rational Reliable Broadcast to ensure that agents can broadcast messages under Hearsay's fault tolerance model. Rational Reliable Broadcast achieves equivalent guarantees to Byzantine Reliable Broadcast [7] but can tolerate the presence of rational agents. To show this, we prove that following the Rational Reliable Broadcast protocol constitutes a Nash equilibrium between rational agents and may therefore be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new permissionless blockchain architecture called ABC. ABC is completely asynchronous, and does rely on neither randomness nor proof-of-work. ABC can be parallelized, and transactions have finality within one round trip of communication. However, ABC satisfies only a relaxed form of consensus by introducing a weaker termination property. Without full consensus, ABC cannot support certain applications, in particular ABC cannot support general smart contracts. However, many important applications do not need general smart contracts, and ABC is a better solution for these applications. In particular, ABC can implement the functionality of a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, replacing Bitcoin’s energyhungry proof-of-work with a proof-of-stake validation.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain-based smart contracts have emerged as a popular means of enforcing agreements among a collection of parties without a prior assumption of trust. However, it has proven difficult to write correct contracts that are robust when operating in the adversarial environment of public blockchains. This thesis evaluates the ability of a domain-specific contract programming language to support the expression and systematic testing of practical smart contracts. We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of Quartz , a contract language based on the state machine model of execution. The design and evaluation of Quartz is grounded in a suite of case study smart contracts. These are intended to span a wide range of application scenarios and design patterns encountered in practice by contract developers. The language’s implementation is organized around the translation of a contract to two targets: a formal specification expressed in TLA+ and an implementation expressed in Solidity. Through its support for model checking contract specifications, Quartz enables the discovery of implementation flaws identical to those that have compromised real-world smart contracts. Moreover, its generated Solidity code imposes at most minor execution overhead compared to equivalent handwritten code. Finally, we discuss Quartz ’s future potential to validate contracts against economic notions of correctness, which are often central concerns in contract design yet are not addressed by current verification techniques.",

LibraBFT is based on HotStuff, a recent protocol that leverages several decades of scientific advances in Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) and achieves the strong scalability and security properties required by internet settings. LibraBFT further refines the HotStuff protocol to introduce explicit liveness mechanisms and provides a concrete latency analysis. To drive the integration with the Libra Blockchain, this document provides specifications extracted from a fully-functional simulator. These specifications include state replication interfaces and a communication framework for data transfer and state synchronization among participants. Finally, this report provides a formal safety proof that induces criteria to detect misbehavior of BFT nodes, coupled with a simple reward and punishment mechanism.",

This has attracted a wide spectrum of applications and users that (i) do not require trusted third parties, (ii) demand transparency, and (iii) demand smart governance, etc.. At the same, it has raised several questions among users, designers and technologists like: • Does your application need a blockchain or DB will do? • Is there a possibility of security breach? • How do we choose a blockchain platform? • Does the platform support Smart Contracts and what is its role in realizing a robust blockchain platform? • How do we match the scalability requirement of the application and the platform? • What will be the impact of the consensus protocol, smart contract language, governance etc., on the security and trust of the platform? • What is the role of Governance, and Interoperability in building a scalable blockchain platform? • ... While clear-cut answers may not be available to many of these questions, in this report, we shall discuss these aspects and provide guidelines for several of these questions. Further, we shall discuss the security threats that exist on various popular platforms and identify threats and vulnerabilities of the platforms with respect to various architectural components like consensus algorithms, transaction ordering and fairness, issues of underlying smart contract languages etc. In the context of integrating a blockchain platform with a production enterprise network, various issues need to be taken into account to maintain a robust continued operation of the enterprise. For instance, security of such an enterprise should look into information security along with platform integrity, physical security, and site integrity. The report, highlights various possible mitigation strategies for components that have been employed or workarounds for these issues. Such a guideline shall assist stakeholders of blockchain platforms to reinforce the trust on the platform for the underlying application to be operated in a robust manner with continuous availability.",

Attacks are constantly growing in sophistication with new threats emerging and likely amplified with other technology trends (e.g., amplification, IoT botnets, 5G connectivity). While great progress has been made in devising many types of mitigation strategies, they are found wanting in light of advanced large-scale attacks and our ability to minimize the impact of the attacks on legitimate services. In this work, we explore a new opportunity for bolstering our DDoS defense arsenal by leveraging recent advances in programmable optics. We envision ONSET: an Optics-enabled In-Network defenSe for Extreme Terabit DDoS attacks. Our approach seeks to isolate and steer attack traffic by dynamic reconfiguration of (backup) wavelengths. This physical isolation of attack traffic enables finer-grained handling of suspicious flows and offers better performance for legitimate traffic in the face of large-scale attacks. In this position paper, we demonstrate the preliminary promise of this vision and identify several open problems at the intersection of security, optical, and systems communities.",

    "abstract": "How crypto flows among Bitcoin users is an important question for understanding the structure and dynamics of the cryptoasset at a global scale. We compiled all the blockchain data of Bitcoin from its genesis to the year 2020, identified users from anonymous addresses of wallets, and constructed monthly snapshots of networks by focusing on regular users as big players. We apply the methods of bow-tie structure and Hodge decomposition in order to locate the users in the upstream, downstream, and core of the entire crypto flow. Additionally, we reveal principal components hidden in the flow by using non-negative matrix factorization, which we interpret as a probabilistic model. We show that the model is equivalent to a probabilistic latent semantic analysis in natural language processing, enabling us to estimate the number of such hidden components. Moreover, we find that the bow-tie structure and the principal components are quite stable among those big players. This study can be a solid basis on which one can further investigate the temporal change of crypto flow, entry and exit of big players, and so forth.",

    "abstract": "Software architectures based on containers and microservices are often used to develop and manage large-scale distributed applications. Still, large vertical deployments spanning over multiple cloud and edge infrastructures are cumbersome to negotiate for, as each infrastructure provider is usually unique concerning prices, management strategies and Quality-of-Service (QoS) levels. In this scenario, Service Level Agreement (SLA) contracts are primarily crafted through pre-established templates and clients must trust providers to manage provisioned resources. The present paper proposes Dawn, a novel blockchain protocol for selecting microservice providers and auditing contracts. The protocol exploits the distributed and verifiable storage of a blockchain, as well as its decentralized consensus to enable contracts establishments in unreliable environments. Besides providing a formal definition of the protocol, this work discusses the possible threats to the correct operation of the network, originated by tenants and providers. We show that Dawn is secure under the evaluated terms, that it can efficiently help the contract establishment process as well as it guarantees a functional systematic way of auditing through monitoring. Finally, we studied both best and worst case scenarios regarding the number of issued messages, stored data volume and network traffic to execute Dawn with different numbers of clients and providers.",

    "abstract": "In current situation, Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) becomes a very serious health concern to the human life throughout the world. The Internet of Medical Things(IoMT) allows to deploy several wearable Internet of Things(IoT) enabled smart devices in a patient's body. The deployed smart devices should then securely communicate to nearby mobile devices installed in a smart home, which then securely communicate with the associated Fog server for information processing. The processed information in terms of transactions are formed as blocks and put into a private blockchain consisting of cloud servers. Since the patient's vital signs are very confidential and private, we apply the private blockchain. This article makes utilization of Fog computing and blockchain technology simultaneously to come up with more secure system in an IoMT-enabled COVID-19 situation for patients' home monitoring purpose. We first discuss various phases related to development of a new Fog-based private blockchain-enabled home monitoring framework. Next, we discuss how Artificial Intelligence(AI)-enabled Big data analytics helps in analyzing and tracking the patients' information related to COVID-19 cases. Finally, a blockchain implementation has been performed to exhibit practical demonstration of the proposed blockchain system.",

    "abstract": "Internet of Drones (IoD)-enabled aerial computing can effectively reduce communication delay and energy consumption as compared to conventional computing environments. It seems very useful for its deployment in disaster areas, emergency relief and battlefield communications. However, different types of attacks, such as replay, man-in-the-middle, impersonation, credential leakage, and other types of data modifications, are possible in an IoD-based communication environment. Therefore, we need a highly robust security protocol to prevent the occurrence of these types of attacks in IoD-enabled aerial computing environments. Moreover, blockchain, a tamper-proof technology, adds more security in the designed security protocol. To cope with these issues, we propose a “blockchain-based secure communication framework for Internet of Drones enabled aerial computing deployment (BCF-IoDAC)”. We also provide a security analysis of the proposed BCF-IoDAC which proves its resilience against various types of passive and active attacks. The security and performance comparison of the proposed BCF-IoDAC is conducted with the closely related existing schemes, and its performance is also better than the compared schemes, as BCF-IoDAC provides more security and functionality features with low computation and communication costs. In addition, the blockchain-based practical demonstration of the proposed BCF-IoDAC is provided to measure its impact on the computational time on a varied number of transactions per block and a varied number of blocks mined in the blockchain.",

In IoV, vehicles, roads, street signs and traffic lights can accordingly adjust to changing conditions in order to assist drivers, and also to improve safety, ease congestion and pollution reduction. Since various entities in an IoV environment make communications over public channels, there are potential security threats. To deal with such serious threats, we design a new blockchain-assisted certificateless key agreement protocol for IoV in smart transportation context, called Block-CLAP. In Block-CLAP, through authentication key management, traffic-centric data reach to a cluster head (CH) and then to its nearby road-side unit (RSU) securely using the established secret keys. A cloud server (CS) then securely collects the information from its attached RSUs and create the transactions. Later, the transactions are formed into blocks by the CS in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud servers network, and the blocks are verified and added through voting-based consensus algorithm in the blockchain. The detailed security analysis through formal, informal and formal security verification, and comparative study show that Block-CLAP provides superior security and has low communication and computational overheads as compared with other existing competing authentication schemes in the IoV environment. Finally, the blockchain-based implementation of Block-CLAP has been performed to measure computational time needed for a varied number of transactions per block and also for a varied number of blocks mined in the blockchain.",

However, this unrepresented growth is tinged by the uncertainty of possible challenges in security and privacy. In this work, we propose a novel blockchain-envisioned fine grained user access control scheme for data security and scalability in IIoT environment. The proposed scheme supports multiple attribute authorities and also a constant size key and ciphertext. The data gathered by the IoT smart devices are encrypted using the cipher-policy attribute based encryption (CP-ABE) and sent to their nearby gateway nodes. Later, the gateway nodes form the transactions from the encrypted data from the smart devices which are used to form partial blocks. The partial blocks are then forwarded to the cloud server(s) in the peer-to-peer (P2P) network to convert them into full blocks, which are verified, mined and added into the blockchain using the voting-based practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm. The proposed scheme also allows a user to access the secure data stored in the blocks into the blockchain using the CP-ABE mechanism. The security analysis demonstrates the robustness of the proposed scheme against various attacks, and the comparative study with related relevant schemes also highlights the advantage of the proposed scheme over existing approaches. Finally, a blockchain implementation of the presented scheme summarizes the computational costs for a varied number of transactions per block, and also for a varied number of blocks mined in the blockchain.",

    "abstract": "Drones, which are also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), are very useful in delivering the packages, and real-time object detection and tracking with minimal human interference. However, there may be several security threats in such an environment, for instance, a malicious user can spy unauthorized drones, transfer malicious packages, or even damage the network reliability that can have direct impact on drones control. This may lead to a potential threat for people, governments, and business sectors. To deal with these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel access control scheme for unauthorized UAV detection and mitigation in an Internet of Drones (IoD) environment, called ACSUD-IoD. With the help of the blockchain-based solution incorporated in ACSUD-IoD, the transactional data having both the normal secure data from a drone (UAV) to the Ground Station Server  and the abnormal (suspected) data for detection of unauthorized UAVs by the  are stored in private blockchain, that are authentic and genuine. As a result, the Big data analytics can be performed on the authenticated transactional data stored in the blockchain. Through the detailed security analysis including formal security under the broadly-accepted Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, formal security verification using the widely-applied Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool and non-mathematical security analysis show the robustness of the proposed scheme against a number of potential attacks needed in an IoD environment. The testbed experiments for various cryptographic primitives using the broadly-accepted Multiprecision Integer and Rational Arithmetic Cryptographic Library (MIRACL) have been performed under both server and Raspberry PI 3 configurations. Furthermore, a detailed comparative analysis among the proposed scheme and other existing competing schemes shows the efficacy and more robustness as compared to the existing schemes. Finally, the blockchain-based practical demonstration shows the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

    "abstract": "Since the creation of the first Bitcoin blockchain in 2009, the number of cryptocurrency users has steadily increased. However, the number of hacking attacks targeting assets stored in these users' cryptocurrency wallets is also increasing. Therefore, we evaluate the security of the wallets currently on the market to ensure that they are safe. We first conduct threat modeling to identify threats to cryptocurrency wallets and identify the security requirements. Second, based on the derived security requirements, we utilize attack trees and Bayesian network analysis to quantitatively measure the risks inherent in each wallet and compare them. According to the results, the average total risk in software wallets is 1.22 times greater than that in hardware wallets. In the comparison of different hardware wallets, we found that the total risk inherent to the Trezor One wallet, which has a general-purpose MCU, is 1.11 times greater than that of the Ledger Nano S wallet, which has a secure element. However, use of a secure element in a cryptocurrency wallet has been shown to be less effective at reducing risks.",

    "abstract": "The inception of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer payment system, and its underlying blockchain data-structure and protocol, has led to an increased interest in deploying scalable and reliable distributed-ledger systems that build on robust consensus protocols. A critical requirement of such systems is to provide enough fault tolerance in the presence of adversarial attacks or network faults. This is essential to guarantee liveness when the network does not behave as expected and ensure that the underlying nodes agree on a unique order of transactions over a shared state. In comparison with traditional distributed systems, the deployment of a distributed-ledger system should take into account the hidden game theoretical aspects of such protocols, where actors are competing with each other in an environment which is likely to experience various well-motivated malicious and adversarial attacks. Firstly, this paper discusses the fundamental principles of existing consensus protocols in the context of both permissioned and permissionless distributed-ledger systems. The main contribution of this work deals with observations from experimenting with Ripple’s consensus protocol as it is embodied in the XRP Ledger. The main experimental finding suggests that, when a low percentage of malicious nodes is present, the centralization degree of the network can be significantly relaxed ensuring low convergence times. Those findings are of particular importance when engineering a consensus algorithm that would like to balance security with decentralization. View Full-Text",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts are immutable digital programs deployed onto blockchain platforms to codify agreements. They enable blockchain technology to play a vital role in many fields, such as finance, health care, and energy. An important aspect of modeling and deploying smart contracts is to define the business process and rules that govern the agreements under which the corresponding actions are executed. Unfortunately, these models use a mix of technical and business-centric terminologies that are different based on the underlying blockchain platform that the smart contract is targeting. To address this issue, in this paper, we followed a feature-oriented domain analysis approach to identify the commonalities and variations between three of the common blockchain platforms that are used to deploy smart contracts; namely IBM Hyperledger Composer, Azure Blockchain Workbench, and Ethereum. Accordingly, we propose a reference model for smart contracts. The reference model is then realized as a modeling framework that enables developers to model and generate the structural code required to deploy a smart contract onto multiple blockchain platforms. The coverage of the proposed reference model was shown through mapping the concepts of the reference models to its corresponding constructs within each blockchain platform. Moreover, we provide three use cases to show how the proposed framework can empower developers to generate the structural code of smart contracts for the target platform through model transformation.",

    "abstract": "Model transformation plays an important role in developing software systems using the model-driven engineering paradigm. Examples of applications of model transformation include forward engineering, reverse engineering of code into models, and refactoring. Poor-quality model transformation code is costly and hard to maintain. There is a need to develop techniques and tools that can support transformation engineers in designing high-quality model transformations. The goal of this paper is to present a process, called MUPPIT (method for using proper patterns in model transformations), which can be used by transformation engineers to improve the quality of model transformations by detecting anti-patterns in the transformations and automatically applying pattern solutions. MUPPIT consists of four phases: (1) identifying a transformation anti-pattern, (2) proposing a pattern-solution, (3) applying the pattern-solution, and (4) evaluating the transformation model. MUPPIT takes a transformation design model (TDM), which is a representation of the given transformation, to search for the presence of an anti-pattern of interest. If found, MUPPIT proposes a pattern solution from a catalogue of patterns to the transformation engineer. The application of the pattern solution results in the restructuring of the TDM. While MUPPIT, as a process, is independent of any transformation language and transformation engineering framework, we have implemented an instance of it as a tool using transML and MeTAGeM, which support exogenous transformations using rule-based transformation and OCL-based languages such as ATL and ETL. We evaluate MUPPIT through a number of case studies in which we show how MUPPIT can detect four anti-patterns and propose the corresponding pattern solutions. We also evaluate MUPPIT by collecting a number of metrics to assess the quality of the resulting transformations. The results show that MUPPIT optimizes the transformations by improving reusability, modularity, simplicity, and maintainability, as well as decreasing the complexity. MUPPIT can help transformation engineers to produce high-quality transformations using a pattern-based approach. An immediate future direction would be to experiment with more anti-patterns and pattern solutions. Moreover, we need to implement MUPPIT using other transformation engineering frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts are computer programs that are automatically executed on the blockchain. Vulnerabilities in their implementation have led to severe loss of cryptocurrency. Smart contracts become immutable when deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, it is essential to understand the nature of vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts to prevent them in the future. Existing classifications exist, but are limited in several ways. Objective: We aim to characterize vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity, and unify existing classifications schemes. Method: We extracted 2143 vulnerabilities from public coding platforms and popular vulnerability databases and categorized them using a card sorting approach. We targeted the Ethereum blockchain in this paper, as it is the first and most popular blockchain to support the deployment of smart contracts, and Solidity as the most widely used language to implement smart contracts. We devised a classification scheme of smart contract vulnerabilities according to their error source and impact. Afterwards, we mapped existing classification schemes to our classification. Results: The resulting classification consists of 11 categories describing the error source of a vulnerability and 13 categories describing potential impacts. Our findings show that the language specific coding and the structural data flow categories are the dominant categories, but that the frequency of occurrence differs substantially between the data sources. Conclusions: Our findings enable researchers to better understand smart contract vulnerabilities by defining various dimensions of the problem and supporting our classification with mappings with literature-based classifications and frequency distributions of the defined categories.",

    "abstract": "Incentive mechanisms are central to the functionality of permissionless blockchains: they incentivize participants to run and secure the underlying consensus protocol. Designing incentive-compatible incentive mechanisms is notoriously challenging, however. As a result, most public blockchains today use incentive mechanisms whose security properties are poorly understood and largely untested. In this work, we propose SquirRL, a framework for using deep reinforcement learning to analyze attacks on blockchain incentive mechanisms. We demonstrate SquirRL’s power by first recovering known attacks: (1) the optimal selfish mining attack in Bitcoin [56], and (2) the Nash equilibrium in block withholding attacks [18]. We also use SquirRL to obtain several novel empirical results. First, we discover a counterintuitive flaw in the widely used rushing adversary model when applied to multi-agent Markov games with incomplete information. Second, we demonstrate that the optimal selfish mining strategy identified in [56] is actually not a Nash equilibrium in the multi-agent selfish mining setting. In fact, our results suggest (but do not prove) that when more than two competing agents engage in selfish mining, there is no profitable Nash equilibrium. This is consistent with the lack of observed selfish mining in the wild. Third, we find a novel attack on a simplified version of Ethereum’s finalization mechanism, Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG) that allows a strategic agent to amplify her rewards by up to 30%. Notably, [12] shows that honest voting is a Nash equilibrium in Casper FFG; our attack shows that when Casper FFG is composed with selfish mining, this is no longer the case. Altogether, our experiments demonstrate SquirRL’s flexibility and promise as a framework for studying attack settings that have thus far eluded theoretical and empirical understanding.",

We propose a set of good practices in the form of design principles that infrastructure services can adopt to mitigate the risks, and we specify a set of design primitives that can be used to support the development of infrastructure that follows the principles.

    "abstract": "Internet technology makes digital value transactions between anonymous individuals possible, but leaves unanswered the question of how to resolve disputes between unidentified parties. Blockchain  dispute  resolution  platforms  provide  a  response  to  this  problem.  In  the  social  dispute  resolution  systems  for  blockchain  currently  in  use,  pseudo  anonymous  jurors  can  resolve disputes between pseudo anonymous parties. This paper presents Kleros as the most illustrative blockchain dispute resolution platform BDRP. To describe the features of the Kleros dispute  resolution  platform  and  the  qualification  of  jurors,  this  research  employs  an  online  dispute resolution survey of both the jurors and stakeholders of the Kleros platform. This study raises  important  questions  about  key  elements  of  procedural  justice  in  resolution  platforms  for  blockchain  disputes.  The  research  underlines  the  pros  and  cons  of  dispute  resolution  for  crowdsourced  blockchain  and  contributes  to  the  further  development  of  online  dispute  resolution  systems.  It  tests  the  wisdom  of  the  crowd  as  the  core  attribute  of  the  resolution  process   in   crowdsource   disputes.   Crowdsource   mass   dispute   resolution,   coupled   with   cooperative jurors and blockchain technology, could ensure greater effectiveness and fairness of the dispute resolution process, especially the adjudication of online small claims disputes.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology is a new general-purpose technology that poses significant challenges to the existing state of law, economy, and society. Blockchain has one feature that makes it even more distinctive than other disruptive technologies: it is, by nature and design, global and transnational. Moreover, blockchain operates based on its own rules and principles that have a law-like quality. What may be called the lex cryptographia of blockchain has been designed based on a rational choice vision of human behavior. Blockchain adopts a framing derived from neoclassical economics, and instantiates it in a new machinery that implements rational choice paradigms using blockchain in a semi-automatic way, across all spheres of life, and without regard to borders. Accordingly, a global law and crypto-economics movement is now emerging owing to the spread of blockchain. This Article suggests that such a rational choice paradigm is an insufficient foundation for the future development of blockchain. It seeks to develop a new understanding of blockchain and its regulation through code according to the emerging “law and political economy” framework. Blockchain is much more than a machine that enables the automation of transactions according to a rational choice framework. Blockchain should instead be understood as a technological infrastructure. Acknowledging the infrastructural dimension of blockchain technology may help identify a new role for the law in its interaction with blockchain, as well as for government in its interaction with the new technology. More precisely, identifying blockchain as an “infrastructural commons” helps us recognize that law and regulation should not be relegated to the role of merely facilitating the operation of the invisible hand of the market by and within blockchain, but should rather acquire more active roles, such as safeguarding access on non-discriminatory terms to users, on a model with net neutrality and other public utility safeguards. The Article closes by proposing a “law and political economy” framework for blockchain that is based on principles of publicness, trust, and interoperability.",

This have created new asymmetries of power, where the “field” of competition is not the relevant product market, as is usually the case in competition law, but rather the ecosystem of various complementary products and associated complementor firms. These dynamics raise novel concerns over competition. After examining the foundational elements of the ecosystem concept, we review how ecosystems are addressed within the current scope of competition law, and identify the gap in the existing framework of conventional competition law. We then move to a critical review of current efforts and proposals in the EU for providing regulatory remedies for ex ante and ex post resolution of problems, focusing on the current (2020) proposals of the Digital Market Act on ex ante regulation, with its particular focus on “gatekeepers.” We also review recent regulatory initiatives in European countries that focus on ex post regulation, and on the role of business models and ecosystem architectures in regulation, before providing a deep dive into proposed Greek legislation that explicitly focuses on ecosystem regulation. We conclude with our observations on the challenges in instituting and implementing a regulatory framework for ecosystems, drawing on research and our own engagement in the regulatory process.",

During the last decade, the world has witnessed a rapid expansion of applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to an increasingly broad range of financial markets and problems. Machine learning and AI algorithms facilitate this process understanding, modelling and forecasting the behaviour of the most relevant financial variables. The main contribution of this book is the presentation of new theoretical and applied AI perspectives to find solutions to unsolved finance questions. This volume proposes an optimal model for the volatility smile, for modelling high-frequency liquidity demand and supply and for the simulation of market microstructure features. Other new AI developments explored in this book includes building a universal model for a large number of stocks, developing predictive models based on the average price of the crowd, forecasting the stock price using the attention mechanism in a neural network, clustering multivariate time series into different market states, proposing a multivariate distance nonlinear causality test and filtering out false investment strategies with an unsupervised learning algorithm. Machine Learning and AI in Finance explores the most recent advances in the application of innovative machine learning and artificial intelligence models to predict financial time series, to simulate the structure of the financial markets, to explore nonlinear causality models, to test investment strategies and to price financial options.

    "abstract": "Idea in Brief-This paper explains a Proof of Concept (PoC) of rewards for recycling plastic, drinking cans and bottles, and its development in Alastria for the tokenization and smartcontracts implementation. The novelty here is that rewards for recycling are leveraged by raffles and lotteries, using Reciclos as a non-fungible token for rewarding recycling for domestic usages. Differently from renown reward programmes for good that focus on waste tax discounts or even further on catalogues of presents, Reciclos is used for raffles and lotteries by purchasing tokens for the participation to the said raffles and tokenised lottery participations, and for donations and crowdfunding. The aim is to increase the effectiveness of the rewards and to make then sustainable in the long term. The trick is making the rewards user-friendly enough, socially well perceived, and attractive to al, seeking for a majority of people that are appealed for the following claims: \"I made millions by simply recycling\" and \"I support social, good projects donating my recycling efforts without cash\". The point is that nobody had created a token as a sort of virtual currency for recycling leveraged by raffles and lotteries and as a Social Proof of Work for donations. So far in late 2018, there were few initiatives like cash for trash and waste lotteries in Australia and the US that went in a similar direction. In this paper, we describe the design of the virtual currency,the lotteries as smart contracts and tokens, and how they were developed as a PoC in the Alastria platform. A. INTRODUCTION: ISSUE AT HAND Reciclos is a reward token leveraged by social proofs of work in recycling that is powered by raffles and donations. It is a paradigm shift in the personal rewards for recycling scene, where people regularly participate in weekly and monthly donations, crowdfunding, and raffles, with jackpots, and special lotteries, among the state of the art incentives like discounts in local waste taxes and donations to ONG of the user's election or crowdfunding of popular initiatives in Reciclos. I anticipate that the development of digital raffles in virtual currencies will continuously impact our societies as I advocate that recycling as a community will share sustainability and game changing values, with strong mutual sympathy and support. Furthermore, creating Reciclos Ꞧ is an opportunity to store (social) proofs of work and commitment in recycling, that is key for the future of the communities of recyclers. At the time, there was a double question that had to be answered in this PoC: \"will a currency move people to recycling more for the very long term and for what reason for: discounts, donations or raffles? Section II will show the hypothesis and precedents of our design. Section III discusses on the tokenisation of Reciclos. The section IV deploys a MVP design. Next, section V is a platform design, followed by further technical stuff of the development proposed for the PoC, while results are displayed in section VI. And finally, section VIII provides the conclusions. B. HYPOTHESIS AND PRECEDENTS The aiming context of the PoC is at contributing to raise the 2018 Spanish recycling rate of 29% up to a 55% as it is the EU (European Union) goal for 2025: the aim is to raise all EU countries well beyond that figure of 55%. The ultimate goal is to prepare the European citizens for a change",

The order flow is the microsecond stream of orders arriving at the exchange, driving the formation of prices seen on the price chart of a stock or currency. To test the stationarity of our proposed model we train our model on data before the 2017 Bitcoin bubble period and test our model during and after the bubble. We show that without any retraining, the proposed model is temporally stable even as Bitcoin trading shifts into an extremely volatile “bubble trouble” period. The significance of the result is shown by benchmarking against existing state-of-the-art models in the literature for modelling price formation using deep learning.",

This utilises smart contracts to automate the custody of collateral and settlement of payouts on expiry. Importantly, our framework also enables forwards to be traded without counterparty risk or reliance on off-chain assets (such as fiat currencies). To achieve this, we build on our previous work on on-chain options and demonstrate how the relevant mathematical guarantees can be extended to forwards. In addition, we discuss recent trends in cryptoasset derivatives, capital requirements, and other design considerations (such as the use of split contracts). This paper will be of interest to academics and practitioners interested in financial smart contracts.",

    "abstract": "Proof-of-Stake blockchains based on a longest-chain consensus protocol are an attractive energy-friendly alternative to the Proof-of-Work paradigm. However, formal barriers to \"getting the incentives right\" were recently discovered, driven by the desire to use the blockchain itself as a source of pseudorandomness \\cite{brown2019formal}. We consider instead a longest-chain Proof-of-Stake protocol with perfect, trusted, external randomness (e.g. a randomness beacon). We produce two main results. First, we show that a strategic miner can strictly outperform an honest miner with just 32.8% of the total stake. Note that a miner of this size {\\em cannot} outperform an honest miner in the Proof-of-Work model. This establishes that even with access to a perfect randomness beacon, incentives in Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake longest-chain protocols are fundamentally different. Second, we prove that a strategic miner cannot outperform an honest miner with 30.8% of the total stake. This means that, while not quite as secure as the Proof-of-Work regime, desirable incentive properties of Proof-of-Work longest-chain protocols can be approximately recovered via Proof-of-Stake with a perfect randomness beacon. The space of possible strategies in a Proof-of-Stake mining game is {\\em significantly} richer than in a Proof-of-Work game. Our main technical contribution is a characterization of potentially optimal strategies for a strategic miner, and in particular, a proof that the corresponding infinite-state MDP admits an optimal strategy that is positive recurrent.",

Real estate is becoming increasingly digital, automated and integrated; embracing connected-buildings, wearable personal devices, integrated transportation systems, buildings and infrastructure data management and smart cities. The key to promoting the use of data-driven techniques in the real estate sector is the introduction of a Data Marketplace that promotes validation of data and tokenisation to create value for the owners of the data, Blockchain security and governance for users of the data, the application of Artifcial Intelligence for data analytics and ethics for governance. The technical capability exists today for a complete end-to-end reshaping of the real estate market based on data and ethics. This is data-driven real estate (cf. Google, Amazon, Alibaba, Tencent). The contributions of this review paper are fourfold: (a) to provide a vision of a fully digital real estate marketplace; (b) to brief the industry on digital technology and also stimulate engagement with the computer science community; (c) to encourage debate amongst professionals, academics and politicians of the benefts of full automation and integration of real estate; (d) present ethics for the Real Estate Data Marketplace based on lawfulness, fairness and transparency",

As a result, societies are losing a critical public retail payment option, and retail consumers are losing important rights associated with using cash. To address this concern, we propose an approach to digital currency that would allow people without banking relationships to transact electronically and privately, including both e-commerce purchases and point-of-sale purchases that are required to be cashless. Our proposal introduces a government-backed, privately-operated digital currency infrastructure to ensure that every transaction is registered by a bank or money services business, and it relies upon non-custodial wallets backed by privacy-enhancing technology, such as blind signatures or zero-knowledge proofs, to ensure that transaction counterparties are not revealed. Our approach to digital currency can also facilitate more efficient and transparent clearing, settlement, and management of systemic risk. We argue that our system can restore and preserve the salient features of cash, including privacy, owner-custodianship, fungibility, and accessibility, while also preserving fractional reserve banking and the existing two-tiered banking system. We also show that it is possible to introduce regulation of digital currency transactions involving non-custodial wallets that unconditionally protect the privacy of end-users.",

P2P provides a mechanism for local balancing when it is facilitated through distributed ledgers (‘blockchains’). Energy communities across Europe have uncovered the potential of this technology and are currently running pilots to test its applicability in P2P energy trading. The aim of this paper is to assess, using legal literature and legislation, whether the legal forms available to energy communities in the United Kingdom (UK) can help resolve some of the uncertainties around the individual use of blockchain for P2P energy trading. This includes the legal recognition of ‘prosumers’, the protection of their personal data, as well as the validity of ‘smart contracts’ programmed to trade energy on the blockchain network. The analysis has shown that legal entities, such as Limited Liability Partnerships and Co-operative Societies, can play a crucial role in providing the necessary framework to protect consumers engaging in these transactions. This is particularly the case for co-operatives, given that they can hold members liable for not respecting the rules set out in their (compulsory) governing document. These findings are relevant to other European countries, where the energy co-operative model is also used.",

Since different types of plastics have various degrees of recyclability, consumer information about plastic product recyclability is paramount in order to increase the levels of plastic recycled. Against this context, the objective of this work is to define a plastic credit system to increase the amount of recyclable plastics. The plastic credit system assigns credit information to each plastic product and its corresponding company based on the percentage recyclability value of the plastic type and its composition. The methodology proposed is based on a unified and transparent credit system established by a double-chain system, which comprises a public blockchain CreditChain and a consortium blockchain M-InfoChain. The results show through the overall system performance analysis that the designed plastic credit system is capable of promoting a demand shift towards plastic products with higher plastic recyclability and achieving a lightweight operation for resource requirements and system maintenance.",

The combination of immutability, enhanced visibility, transparency and data integrity provides numerous benefits that improve trust in extended food supply chains (FSCs). Blockchain can enhance traceability, enable more efficient recall and aids in risk reduction of counterfeits and other forms of illicit trade. Moreover, blockchain can enhance the integrity of credence claims such as sustainably sourced, organic or faith-based claims such as kosher or halal by integrating the authoritative source of the claim (e.g., the certification body or certification owner) into the blockchain to verify the claim integrity and reassure business customers and end consumers. Despite the promises and market hype, a comprehensive overview of the potential benefits and challenges of blockchain in FSCs is still missing. To bridge this knowledge gap, we present the findings from a systematic review and bibliometric analysis of sixty-one (61) journal articles and synthesize existing research. The main benefits of blockchain technology in FCSs are improved food traceability, enhanced collaboration, operational efficiencies and streamlined food trading processes. Potential challenges include technical, organizational and regulatory issues. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our research and present several ideas for future research.",

However, the question remains as to how cities can become “smart”. The application of information technology is generally considered a key driver in the “smartization” of cities. Detailed frameworks and procedures are therefore needed to guide, operationalize, and measure the implementation process as well as the impact of the respective technologies. In this paper, we discuss blockchain technology, a novel driver of technological transformation that comprises a multitude of underlying technologies and protocols, and its potential impact on smart cities. We specifically address the question of how blockchain technology may benefit the development of urban areas. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we present a framework and research propositions. We identify nine application fields of blockchain technology in the smartization of cities: (1) healthcare, (2) logistics and supply chains, (3) mobility, (4) energy, (5) administration and services, (6) e-voting, (7) factory, (8) home and (9) education. We discuss current developments in these fields, illustrate how they are affected by blockchain technology and derive propositions to guide future research endeavors.",

This study addresses this challenge by introducing a bottom-up framework for cooperative flexibility scheduling that relies on a decentralized network of scheduling agents to perform a coordinated decision-making and select a subset of households’ net load schedules that fulfills the techno-socio-economic prosumer objectives in the resource operation modes and ensures the reliability of the grid. The resource flexibility in terms of alternative operation schedules is mathematically modeled with multiobjective optimization that attains economic, environmental, and energy self-sufficiency prosumer goals with respect to their relative importance. The coordination is achieved with a privacy-preserving collective learning algorithm that aims to reduce the aggregated peak demand of the households considering prosumers’ willingness to cooperate and accept a less preferred resource schedule. By utilizing the framework and real-world data, the novel case study is demonstrated for prosumers equipped with solar battery systems in a community microgrid. The findings show that the flexibility scheduling with an optimal prosumer cooperation level decreases the global costs of collective peak shaving by 83% while increasing the local prosumer costs by 28% in comparison with noncooperative scheduling. However, the forecast uncertainty in net load and parameters of the frequency containment reserve causes imbalances in the planned schedules. It is suggested that the imbalances can be decreased if the flexibility modeling takes into account variable specific levels of forecast uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "The paper proposes an explainable Artificial Intelligence model that can be used in credit risk management and, in particular, in measuring the risks that arise when credit is borrowed employing peer to peer lending platforms. The model applies correlation networks to Shapley values so that Artificial Intelligence predictions are grouped according to the similarity in the underlying explanations. The empirical analysis of 15,000 small and medium companies asking for credit reveals that both risky and not risky borrowers can be grouped according to a set of similar financial characteristics, which can be employed to explain their credit score and, therefore, to predict their future behaviour.",

    "abstract": "In conventional transactions, written contracts usually memorialize the terms of the commercial exchange. For deals in which some of the goods being transferred and the forum for the trade are digitized — as in the case of cryptocurrencies — parties may use computer code rather than a written contract to record their terms. Such pieces of code are sometimes called “smart contracts” because they perform many of the same functions as contracts but are expressed in a computing language. Coded exchanges embody a potentially revolutionary contracting innovation. But they are difficult to assimilate into traditional contracting terminology, conceptual framing, and doctrine. This Article begins by distilling the central legally and practically significant type of smart contracts — what we call “transactional scripts.” It then develops an account of how these scripts, which operate on public blockchains, are created, the economic barriers to their adoption, and how they produce errors of legal significance. This account, in turn, allows us to more rigorously and accessibly situate transactional scripts in existing legal doctrine. Commentators are enthusiastic about scripts in part because, the story goes, they are “self-executing” and require no third-party adjudicators. Yet we show that optimism to be unfounded by documenting how scripts, like ordinary contracts, can result in misunderstanding, frustrated intent, and failure. When code misdelivers, disappointed parties will seek legal recourse. We argue that jurists should situate scripts within other legally operative statements and disclosures, or contract stacks. Precision about the relationship between script and stack sustains a novel framework, rooted in old doctrines of interpretation, parol evidence and equity, that will help jurists compile answers to the private law problems that digitized exchange entails.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digitalisation of the global economy and industry. However, the Next Generation EU (NG-EU) plan, which aims to provide a strong economic recovery for EU member states, has been criticised for its allocation delay and increased risk of hysteresis, that is, the dependence of the state of a system on its history. Under these circumstances, this paper proposes a blockchain-based two-layer system, Next Generation Digital Currency (NGDC), to assist an accountable and transparent fund allocation process for NG-EU funds. A consortium network in layer one is designed for all EU member state central banks and the European Central Bank (ECB) to maintain a trustable and verifiable fund tracking ledger. A Prime-Coordinator PBFT (PC-PBFT) consensus mechanism-based agreement protocol is proposed to resolve discrepancies in the transaction validation process. The simulation results show that PC-PBFT can support at least 30 transactions per second (tps) with transaction processing time less than 1 second on average.",

    "abstract": "As an integral part of the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem, Automated Market Maker (AMM) based Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) have gained massive traction with the revived interest in blockchain and distributed ledger technology in general. Most prominently, the top six AMMs -- Uniswap, Balancer, Curve, DODO, Bancor and Sushiswap -- hold in aggregate 15 billion USD worth of crypto-assets as of March 2021. Instead of matching the buy and sell sides, AMMs employ a peer-to-pool method and determine asset price algorithmically through a so-called conservation function. Compared to centralized exchanges, AMMs exhibit the apparent advantage of decentralization, automation and continuous liquidity. Nonetheless, AMMs typically feature drawbacks such as high slippage for traders and divergence loss for liquidity providers. This work establishes a general AMM framework describing the economics and formalizing the system's state-space representation. We employ our framework to systematically compare the top AMM protocols' mechanics, deriving their slippage and divergence loss functions. We further discuss security and privacy concerns associated with AMM DEXs, and conduct a comprehensive literature review on related work covering both DeFi and conventional market microstructure.",

    "abstract": "Digitisation is often viewed as beneficial to a user. Where originally people would physically have to identify to a service, pay for a ticket in cash, or go into a library to access a book, people can now achieve all of this through a click of a button. While these actions may seem functionally identical to their analogue counterparts, they come with one important difference. Namely, in the digital case, a user's actions are automatically recorded. The recording of user's interactions presents a problem because this information can be used outside the control of the person whom it concerns. This issue is only exacerbated by the centralisation of these aforementioned services' authentication mechanisms permitting the collection of even more data. This work aims to motivate the need and establish the feasibility for the application of a privacy-enhancing digital token management service to public transit. A proof-of-concept implementation of the Decentralised Digital Identity Architecture proposed by Goodell and Aste is developed. This implementation was optimised for the public transport use case. Finally, its performance is tested in a local environment to better understand the technical challenges and assess such a system's technical feasibility in a production setting. It was observed that for loads between 1 and 5 requests per second the proof-of-concept performs within acceptable limits with a maximum median response time of 334 milliseconds. Above 5 requests per second response times drastically increase due to hardware bottlenecks. It was concluded that the demonstrated throughput and latency shows that the system can feasibly compete with solutions currently in use. Yet, further work is needed to demonstrate these performance characteristics in an environment similar to that experienced in production.",

In this informal analysis and design proposal, we describe how infrastructure for digital assets can serve as a useful monetary and fiscal policy tool and an enabler of existing tools in the future, particularly during crises, while aligning the trajectory of financial technology innovation toward a brighter future. We propose an approach to digital currency that would allow people without banking relationships to transact electronically and privately, including both internet purchases and point of-sale purchases that are required to be cashless. We also propose an approach to digital currency that would allow for more efficient and transparent clearing and settlement, implementation of monetary and fiscal policy, and management of systemic risk. The digital currency could be implemented as central bank digital currency (CBDC), or it could be issued by the government and collateralised by public funds or Treasury assets. Our proposed architecture allows both manifestations and would be operated by banks and other money services businesses, operating within a framework overseen by government regulators. We argue that now is the time for action to undertake development of such a system, not only because of the current crisis but also in anticipation of future crises resulting from geopolitical risks, the continued globalisation of the digital economy, and the changing value and risks that technology brings.",

    "abstract": "Digital currencies present an opportunity to equalize access to financial systems and reduce the cost and latency of trading assets or transferring money. An ideal exchange for these assets would itself be a blockchain; such a system could be decentralized and transparent, among other desirable properties. The primary difficulty in implementing a multi-asset exchange on a blockchain, as opposed to in a traditional centralized setting, is that blockchain nodes must operate deterministically and replicably. In this work, we introduce a new approach to matching requests to trade assets such that all transactions is a block commute with each other. That is to say, transaction execution can be parallelized over an arbitrary number of off-the-shelf CPU cores with minimal synchronization overhead. This approach also introduces independently useful properties, such as removing the need to trade in and out of a reserve currency. Our approach is to view an asset exchange as an instance of the Arrow-Debreu exchange market, where each asset is valued in an abstract “phantom” currency. The central algorithmic difficulty of this approach is in computing equilibrium prices. For the case where the exchange only supports sell orders, we show how existing convex programming techniques can be adapted to compute equilibrium prices efficiently, in both theory and empirically. We also show how even approximate (or “noisy”) prices can be used to find a market-clearing solution with many desirable properties. Finally, we show that supporting both sell and buy orders in these markets makes the price computation a PPAD-hard problem. We believe that our work points to a viable implementation path for sophisticated and robust multi-asset exchanges for digital currencies.",

    "abstract": "Data and consumer privacy are topics that must be effectively addressed if governments plan to implement CBDCs in any way, shape, or form in the future. While Internet-of-Things (IoT) gadgets and other technology devices have certainly improved consumer quality-of-life in the past two decades, such devices provide a path for the increased exploitation of consumer data in the modern age. Consumer data can be exploited for crimes to include identify theft, industry disruption, and much more. However, more importantly, personal data, to include financial data, can be used to identify and coerce individual behavior. This is especially concerning given the current nature of Great Power Competition, with the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Russia, and the United States increasingly competing with one another for global influence. Of these nations, the PRC has the most to gain through the implementation of a CBDC; China’s ever- expanding Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) merged with a home-grown digital currency would provide the PRC with the ability to disrupt the American dollar, and to a lesser extent, the Russian rubble, as a primary asset within the realm of international trade and other global functions.",

    "abstract": "There have been several 51% attacks on Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains recently, including Verge and GameCredits, but the most noteworthy has been the attack that saw hackers make off with up to $18 million after a successful double-spend was executed on the Bitcoin Gold network. For this reason, the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm, which already has advantages of energy efficiency and throughput, is attracting attention as an alternative to the PoW algorithm. With a PoS, the attacker needs to obtain 51% of the cryptocurrency to carry out a 51% attack. But unlike PoW, the attacker in a PoS system is highly discouraged from launching 51% attack because he would have to risk losing his entire stake amount to do so. Moreover, even if a 51% attack succeeds, the value of PoS-based cryptocurrency will fall, and the attacker with the most stake will eventually lose the most. In this paper, we try to derive the results that go against these conventional myths. Despite the significant depreciation of cryptocurrency, our method can make a profit from a 51% attack on the PoS blockchains using the traditional stock market's short selling (or shorting) concept. Our findings are an example to show that the conventional myth that \"a destructive attack that destroys the blockchain ecosystem totally will not occur because it is fundamentally unprofitable to the attacker itself\" may be wrong.",

Blockchain technology’s unique architecture provides individuals greater control over their information and may help address some of the problems related to health data. A multidisciplinary team designed and tested a blockchain application, MediLinker, as a patient-centric identity management system. Methods: The study used simulated data of “avatars” representing different types of patients. Thirty study participants were enrolled to visit simulated clinics, and perform various activities using MediLinker. Evaluation was based on Bouras’ criteria for patient-centric identity management and on the number of errors in entry and sharing of data by participants. Results: Twenty-nine of the 30 participants completed all study activities. MediLinker fulfilled all of Bouras’ criteria except for one which was not testable. A majority of data errors were due to user error, such as wrong formatting and misspellings. Generally, the number of errors decreased with time. Due to COVID-19, sprint 2 was completed using “virtual” clinic visits. The number of user errors were less in virtual visits than in personal visits. Discussion: The evaluation of MediLinker provides some evidence of the potential of a patient-centric identity management system using blockchain technology. The results showed a working system where patients have greater control over their information and can also easily provide consent for use of their data. Conclusion: Blockchain applications for identity management hold great promise for use in healthcare but further research is needed before real-world adoption.",

We proposed to conduct qualitative research to generate insights for developing a market strategy to build a research lab for the promotion of blockchain technologies in health in academic environments. The team aimed to identify the key barriers and opportunities for developing a sustainable research lab that generates research, education, and application of blockchain in healthcare at an academic medical institution and test those strategies in a real-world scenario. Methods: The research team identified potential customers and stakeholders through interviews and snowball sampling. The team conducted semi-structured interviews with 4 faculty researchers, 10 industry leaders, and 6 students from a variety of disciplines and organizations. The findings of these research activities informed our understanding of the needs of stratified customers and helped identify key assets and activities the lab will have to offer to meet those needs. Results: The research insights from data analysis were used to build the business model for establishing a blockchain in health impact lab. This systematic study of areas where blockchain technology can impact health will guide the future development of research agenda for the researchers on campus. Conclusion: Based on our learnings, we hope to design a Blockchain in Health Impact Lab to serve as a platform for students and faculty to come together with industry partners and explore current challenges of blockchain in healthcare. The academic medical center’s partnership with other healthcare providers will help create real-world opportunities to demonstrate and implement new technologies.",

Both a lack of accurate and timely data and pervasive misinformation are causing increasing harm and growing tension between data privacy and public health concerns. Objective: This aim of this paper is to describe how blockchain, with its distributed trust networks and cryptography-based security, can provide solutions to data-related trust problems. Methods: Blockchain is being applied in innovative ways that are relevant to the current COVID-19 crisis. We describe examples of the challenges faced by existing technologies to track medical supplies and infected patients and how blockchain technology applications may help in these situations. Results: This exploration of existing and potential applications of blockchain technology for medical care shows how the distributed governance structure and privacy-preserving features of blockchain can be used to create “trustless” systems that can help resolve the tension between maintaining privacy and addressing public health needs in the fight against COVID-19. Conclusions: Blockchain relies on a distributed, robust, secure, privacy-preserving, and immutable record framework that can positively transform the nature of trust, value sharing, and transactions. A nationally coordinated effort to explore blockchain to address the deficiencies of existing systems and a partnership of academia, researchers, business, and industry are suggested to expedite the adoption of blockchain in health care.",

    "abstract": "Background: In the homeless population, barriers to housing and supportive services include a lack of control or access to data. Disparate data formats and storage across multiple organizations hinder up-to-date intersystem access to records and a unified view of an individual’s health and documentation history. The utility of blockchain to solve interoperability in health care is supported in recent literature, but the technology has yet to be tested in real-life conditions encompassing the complex regulatory standards in the health sector. Objective: This study aimed to test the feasibility and performance of a blockchain system in a homeless community to securely store and share data across a system of providers in the health care ecosystem. Methods: We performed a series of platform demonstrations and open-ended qualitative feedback interviews to determine the key needs and barriers to user and stakeholder adoption. Account creation and data transactions promoting organizational efficiency and improved health outcomes in this population were tested with homeless users and service providers. Results: Persons experiencing homelessness and care organizations could successfully create accounts, grant and revoke data sharing permissions, and transmit documents across a distributed network of providers. However, there were issues regarding the security of shared data, user experience and adoption, and organizational preparedness for service providers as end users. We tested a set of assumptions related to these problems within the project time frame and contractual obligations with an existing blockchain-based platform. Conclusions: Blockchain technology provides decentralized data sharing, validation, immutability, traceability, and integration. These core features enable a secure system for the management and distribution of sensitive information. This study presents a concrete evaluation of the effectiveness of blockchain through an existing platform while revealing limitations from the perspectives of user adoption, cost-effectiveness, scalability, and regulatory frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Most applications for the Internet of Things operate on embedded systems. In particular, embedded devices intended for smart healthcare, smart homes, and smart cars generate logs containing sensitive user information. These logs must be protected from malicious users while also being accessible for legitimate users to utilize them for providing customized services. Unfortunately, the existing logging system only supporting one-to-one encryption based on a server-client model, so there are limitations in building a decentralized logging infrastructure for the hyper-connected era. In this paper, we propose a new secure logging method that supports one-to-many encryption and extends existing logging systems to a decentralized logging infrastructure. In the proposed method, log publishers are able to encrypt generated logs and distribute them to cloud storage in real time and can ensure that only authorized log subscribers access the logs. For one-to-many encryption, we apply a key-policy attribute-based encryption scheme which is suitable for logging systems. For reliability and efficiency of logs, we apply a key-derivation process that cooperates with one-way hash functions within a trusted execution environment. In a real time logging scenario, the proposed method is 93% faster and occupies 83% less storage space than when an original attribute-based encryption scheme is applied. In addition, performance-tunable parameters can optimize our method for various environments.",

    "abstract": "The article offers a novel approach to the threshold questions on the applicability of securities law to digital assets. The clarity of this framework should be useful to courts, regulators, and market participants. Digital-asset development involves two stages, and securities law is essential only in Stage One. However, federal securities law may apply post-launch and post-asset-delivery, i.e., during the Second Stage of a digital asset project, but in a limited way. During Stage Two, there can be two distinct and separate types of assets – a non-security-token (or coin) and a bond - simultaneously circulating after the project has been deployed and tokens distributed. In addition, there are two groups of digital asset purchasers: the initial investors who own tokens post-delivery and post-platform-launch and the subsequent token purchasers. They exist concurrently. These two cohorts of market participants have completely divergent expectations concerning the role of the issuer in the operation of the platform and the valuation of digital assets. Only the initial “bondholders” have claims against the issuer in Stage Two.",

    "abstract": "The blockchain revolution in capital and financial markets attracted the attention of enforcement agencies in many jurisdictions. This Article elaborates the results of an international enforcement survey of the Blockchain and Fintech Research Program of the Rutgers Center for Corporate Law and Governance. It provides a detailed analysis of enforcement in major crypto-market jurisdictions. The data suggest that, despite an extended network of agreements facilitating international cooperation, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) maintains its historically active enforcement posture. The SEC brings more enforcement actions against cryptoasset issuers, broker-dealers, crypto-exchanges, and other digital-asset market participants than most other major crypto-jurisdictions, as well as the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission. SEC enforcement results in considerably more serious penalties. Our data raise theoretical questions on regulation via enforcement, its effect on financial innovations, and regulatory competition. The U.S. does not have a separate regulation designed for the decentralized ledger technology industry and related financial markets, which effectively creates a pure regulation via enforcement environment. To the extent that the U.S. agencies pursue actions not only against domestic companies but also foreign firms, which raise only part of their capital from United States investors, their actions impact global crypto-markets and raise regulatory competition concerns.",

    "abstract": "Machiavelli famously said that actions of all men, particularly of regulators, should be judged by the results. Paraphrasing Machiavelli, the end justifies the means. This Article addresses a situation where the means undermine the regulatory ends. The focus of this Article is the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the major capital-market watchdog. Created in the wake of the Great Depression, the SEC pursues a ternary set of objectives, including protecting investors, maintaining efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation. This Article examines a fundamental disconnect between the objectives of the SEC and the actual outcome of its policies in digital-asset markets—the agency’s enforcement efforts under the mantra of protecting investors and providing digital-asset markets with more information have produced an environment with less information. This disconnect between the SEC’s means and ends is relevant not only to cryptoasset investors but also to other purchasers such as consumers and users. Using two hand-collected datasets, the Article shows that following an increase in enforcement, cryptoasset issuers have attempted to comply with securities law by resorting to private placements. This compliance option reduces market transparency and is harmful to the less sophisticated crypto-investors. In contrast, the more sophisticated crypto-investors rely on what the Article calls “the pure-information model” that exists independently of the SEC-enforced regulations. To conclude, in actively enforcing pre-digital-asset law, the SEC has funneled crypto-issuers into inadequate and lackadaisical compliance with exemptions and created a status quo that is antithetical to the SEC’s core mission of protecting investors. This status quo is also harmful to crypto-issuers, who face higher capital costs. As no one wins in this scenario, a reform revising crypto-issuer disclosure is needed.",

    "abstract": "Due to the popularity of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, the increasing digitalization of payments, and the constantly reducing role of cash in society, central banks have shown an increased interest in deploying central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) that could serve as a digital cash-equivalent. While most recent research on CBDCs focuses on blockchain technology, it is not clear that this choice of technology provides the optimal solution. In particular, the centralized trust model of a CBDC offers opportunities for different designs.vIn this paper, we depart from blockchain designs and instead build on ideas from traditional e-cash schemes. We propose a new style of building digital currencies that combines the transaction processing model of e-cash with an account-based fund management model. We argue that such a style of building digital currencies is especially well-suited to CBDCs. We also design the first such digital currency system, called Platypus, that provides strong privacy, high scalability, and expressive but simple regulation, which are all critical features for a CBDC. Platypus achieves these properties by adapting techniques similar to those used in anonymous blockchain cryptocurrencies like Zcash to fit our account model and applying them to the e-cash context.",

The starting point of our solution is an off-chain execution model, where the contract’s issuers appoints a set of service providers to execute the contract’s code. The contract’s execution results are accepted if a quorum of service providers reports the same result and clients are free to choose which such contracts they trust and use. The main technical contribution of this paper is how to realize such a trust model securely and efficiently without modifying the underlying blockchain. We also identify a set of generic properties that a blockchain system must support so that expressive smart contracts can be added safely, and analyze popular existing blockchains based on these criteria.",

We present an IOP that simultaneously achieves the properties of zero knowledge, linear-time proving, and polylogarithmic-time verification. We construct a zero-knowledge IOP where, for the satisfiability of an N-gate arithmetic circuit over any field of size Ω(N), the prover uses O(N) field operations and the verifier uses polylog(N) field operations (with proof length O(N) and query complexity polylog(N)). Polylogarithmic verification is achieved in the holographic setting for every circuit (the verifier has oracle access to a linear-time-computable encoding of the circuit whose satisfiability is being proved). Our result implies progress on a basic goal in the area of efficient zero knowledge. Via a known transformation, we obtain a zero knowledge argument system where the prover runs in linear time and the verifier runs in polylogarithmic time; the construction is plausibly post-quantum and only makes a black-box use of lightweight cryptography (collision-resistant hash functions).",

Although political economy scholarship has begun to focus on digital currencies, this research has largely focused on single early examples like Bitcoin.

In this article, I revisit the history of digital currencies with explicit attention to not only economic inefficiencies but also political power structures and offer a new typology for theoretically organizing digital currencies along dimensions relevant to practitioners of political economy. I illustrate that variation along these typological dimensions produces important differences among different digital currencies and, relatedly, I explore the implications this has for digital currencies’ externalities and governance demands. Drawing on this typology, I conclude with a proposed research agenda for the political economy of digital currencies.",

Although political economy scholarship has begun to focus on digital currencies, this research has largely focused on single early examples like Bitcoin. In this dissertation, I offer a systematic initial analysis of how digital currencies intersect with traditional dynamics of global political economy. The first chapter explores the ecosystem of digital currencies and theoretically organizes different digital currencies along technical features that are relevant for domestic and global governance. The second chapter proposes a theory of strategic interaction in a particular class of digital money, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and identifies testable hypotheses premised in a theoretical framework of pressures associated with CBDCs that either align with or update prior government preferences. The third and fourth chapter respectively test hypotheses pertaining to theoretical expectations of CBDC project timing and design choices, demonstrating strong support for the proposed theory using a wide battery of statistical tests on novel empirical data produced in this dissertation project. The fifth chapter extrapolates trends from the third and fourth chapter, proposing a novel relational theory of first-mover advantage in CBDC projects premised on theories of policy diffusion and demonstrates support for these theoretical expectations with evidence from social network analysis on the datasets described in the preceding chapters. The sixth chapter concludes with a summary of insights, a set of policy prescriptions for decision-makers arising from this new knowledge, and lines for future research on this topic.",

    "abstract": "A zk-SNARK is a powerful cryptographic primitive that provides a succinct and efficiently checkable argument that the prover has a witness to a public NP statement, without revealing the witness. However, in their native form, zk-SNARKs only apply to a secret witness held by a single party. In practice, a collection of parties often need to prove a statement where the secret witness is distributed or shared among them. We implement and experiment with collaborative zkSNARKs: proofs over the secrets of multiple, mutually distrusting parties. We construct these by lifting conventional zk-SNARKs into secure protocols among N provers to jointly produce a single proof over the distributed witness. We optimize the proof generation algorithm in pairing-based zkSNARKs so that algebraic techniques for multiparty computation (MPC) yield efficient proof generation protocols. For some zk-SNARKs, optimization is more challenging. This suggests MPC \"friendliness\" as an additional criterion for evaluating zk-SNARKs. We implement three collaborative proofs and evaluate the concrete cost of proof generation. We find that over a 3Gb/s link, security against a malicious minority of provers can be achieved with approximately the same runtime as a single prover. Security against N −1 malicious provers requires only a 2× slowdown. This efficiency is unusual since most computations slow down by orders of magnitude when securely distributed. This efficiency means that most applications that can tolerate the cost of a single-prover proof should also be able to tolerate the cost of a collaborative proof.",

A (function hiding) functional commitment scheme enables a \\textit{committer} to commit to a secret function  and later prove that  for public  and  without revealing any other information about . As such, functional commitments allow the operator of a secret process to prove that the process is being applied uniformly to everyone. For example, one can commit to the secret function that computes credit scores and then prove that it is applied uniformly to all. To build a functional commitment scheme, we introduce a new primitive called a proof of function relation (PFR) to show that a committed relation is a function. We show that combining a suitable preprocessing zk-SNARK (or more precisely, an Algebraic Holographic Proof) with a PFR yields a secure functional commitment scheme. We then construct efficient PFRs for two popular preprocessing zk-SNARKs, and obtain two functional commitment schemes for arithmetic circuits. Along the way we develop new techniques for proving interesting properties of committed polynomials, which may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Blockchains benefit from guarantees of immutability and reliability due to their high redundancy and distributed nature. They show their value especially when operating between untrusted parties. Their functionality can be extended program-matically by smart contracts, but are limited by high costs of on-chain computation and only being able to truly trust data which is directly included on-chain. To attempt to bridge this limitation, blockchain oracles are introduced as a conceptual solution to act as a trusted source of information within the blockchain. The Oracle Problem emerges as we consider how one can introduce trusted information into a trust-free environment without compromising the validity of the blockchain. Many promising designs for oracle mechanisms have been proposed, but it is not readily apparent how one should assess the applicability of a given mechanism, nor the strengths and features between mechanisms. To be equipped to assess and categorize oracles, we must consider not just the possible answers, but the questions to which these oracles are trying to speak. Categorizing questions by their possible answering populations, we propose a framework for considering oracle questions and the context with which they are posed. We observe that there are limitations to what an oracle can hope to achieve, depending on the nature of the question, while noting the context in which a question exists can change what is viewed as true.",

We review the issuance of crypto-assets. We start with cryptocurrencies (and their impact on monetary policy), move to initial coin offerings, and finally discuss the issuance of other crypto-assets that are backed by a wide range of underlying assets. We then analyze the post-issuance behavior of these crypto-assets. We explore market integrity, market efficiency, and market microstructure issues. Lastly, we consider the token economy with a special interest in the theory of the firm and industrial organization.",

    "abstract": "Financial regulators around the world regulate financial intermediaries and activities to achieve their regulatory goals including investor/consumer protection, financial stability and prevention of financial crimes, and in so doing address various market failures. These objectives are needed in the social interest regardless of the technologies used by the financial system. Blockchain technology and any financial ecosystem based on it have technical characteristics including decentralization, autonomization, anonymization and globalization, which could undermine the ability of regulators to achieve regulatory goals. Especially when it comes to preventing financial crimes, these characteristics could have significant negative impact on the ability of regulators. The intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force (\"FATF\")' recognizes these issues and is tackling them by issuing multiple guidelines; however, it seems that such efforts are falling behind rapid technological developments. Thus, financial regulators must discover ways to achieve regulatory goals even in a blockchain-based financial ecosystem. This situation is similar to the case of telecommunication regulators during the rise of the Internet. The Internet complicated their regulatory goals including intellectual property rights protection and contents regulation. Thus, their relevant experiences provide a good reference. In the face of such difficulties in cyberspace, it was suggested to invoke not just law but also social norms, market mechanisms and architecture (software and hardware) to achieve a certain level of oversight. In fact, various stakeholders cooperated towards utilizing these modes of oversight in order to address issues brought by the Internet. Based on the lessons from the Internet, financial regulators should recognize that cooperation between multi-stakeholders would be beneficial for them, and they should actively play a role towards establishing a cooperative environment among stakeholders. Especially because code embedded in a blockchain system could determine the level of oversight on the activities within a blockchain-based financial ecosystem, regulators should consider ways to cooperate with engineering communities developing code despite often disparate incentives and mindsets. Once regulators successfully establish a cooperative relationship with the engineering community and can together develop code that facilitates mechanisms to achieve regulatory goals, they still must empower society to use such code in order to actually achieve regulatory goals, which requires consideration on alignment with social norms and market competitiveness; thus, regulators must cooperate with other stakeholders including businesses and users. Through these considerations, this paper concludes that regulators should establish multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms within a blockchain-based financial ecosystem by improving cooperation among stakeholders. The final part of this paper provides some thoughts on relevant open questions, which we will continue to work on.",

    "abstract": "In December 2014, Estonia became the first nation to open its digital borders to enable anyone, anywhere in the world to apply to become an e-Resident. Estonian e-Residency is essentially a commercial initiative. The e-ID issued to Estonian e-Residents enables commercial activities with the public and private sectors. It does not provide citizenship in its traditional sense, and the e-ID provided to e-Residents is not a travel document. However, in many ways it is an international ‘passport’ to the virtual world. E-Residency is a profound change and the recent announcement that the Estonian government is now partnering with Bitnation to offer a public notary service to Estonian e-Residents based on blockchain technology is of significance. The application of blockchain to e-Residency has the potential to fundamentally change the way identity information is controlled and authenticated. This paper examines the legal, policy, and technical implications of this development.",

The stock had long been heavily shorted even before the pandemic. A stock bubble and its collapse inflict collateral damage even on those not participating in the bubble, including index-fund investors. The incident raises questions about the duties of brokers and financial service professionals in the age of social media, and the role of payment for order flow (PFOF). The price dislocation in GameStop highlights several leaks in the plumbing of the US equity market that need to be plugged or else similar dislocations will happen again. The antiquated T+2 settlement cycle needs to be shortened to reduce risk and attendant collateral needs in the system. Institutional short positions should be disclosed on SEC Form 13F just as long positions are. The frequency of short interest disclosure should be increased to daily from the current biweekly. The SEC should implement the Congressional mandate in Dodd-Frank §894 to increase transparency in the stock lending market by implementing a ticker tape for stock lending transactions. Short positions should be marked to market yearly for tax purposes yearly to eliminate the tax incentive to delay covering short positions. SEC rules 204 and 15c3-3 need to be modernized to help prevent spikes in prices far beyond any reasonable levels. Rule 606 should be extended to require brokers to report retail execution quality.",

This chapter reviews existing research on these new functions of robo-advising with a special emphasis on the questions that are still open for researchers across several disciplines. We also discuss the attempts to optimize jointly all personal-finance decisions, which we label ``holistic robo-advisors.''

Comparing the choices lenders make with those made by the robo-advising tool on their behalf, we find that both in-group vs. out-group discrimination and stereotypical discrimination are pervasive and economically sizable. Discrimination makes lenders worse off in terms of consumption utility—discriminating lenders face 32% higher default rates and about 11% lower returns on the loans they issue to borrowers belonging to favored demographics, relative to borrowers in the discriminated groups. All the results are stronger for lenders who reside in regions where the salience of cultural biases is higher.",

    "abstract": "We use a broad survey to elicit investor needs and their satisfaction in the context of financial advice. We provide evidence that traditionally-advised individuals do not hire financial advisors mainly to maximize portfolio returns. They instead hire financial advisors to satisfy a broader set of needs. These needs include acquiring \"peace of mind,\" having access to the opinions of an expert and delegating financial decisions. We also show the majority of investors do not know how much they pay for financial advice, but the miscalculation of the costs of financial advice are unlikely to drive the decision to hire financial advisors. Robo-advised investors are more interested in the financial performance of their portfolio. They also view robo-advising as an empowering tool that can contribute to their own self-improvement. Even robo-advised investors, however, value greatly the possibility to reach out and interact with humans. Our results provide novel evidence on why individual investors choose to hire financial advisors. They also inform on the optimal design of robo-advisers.",

In this paper, we conduct a measurement study on cryptojacking network traffic and propose CryptoJacking-Sniffer (CJ-Sniffer), an easily deployable, privacyaware approach to protecting all devices within a network against cryptojacking. Compared with existing approaches that suffer from privacy concerns or high overhead, CJ-Sniffer only needs to access anonymized, content-agnostic metadata of network traffic from the gateway of the network to efficiently detect cryptojacking traffic. In particular, while cryptojacking traffic is also cryptocurrency mining traffic, CJ-Sniffer is the first approach to distinguishing cryptojacking traffic from user-initiated cryptocurrency mining traffic, making it possible to only filter cryptojacking traffic, rather than blindly filtering all cryptocurrency mining traffic as commonly practiced. After constructing a statistical model to identify all the cryptocurrency mining traffic, CJ-Sniffer extracts variation vectors from packet intervals and utilizes a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to further identify cryptojacking traffic. We evaluated CJSniffer with a packet-level cryptomining dataset. Our evaluation results demonstrate that CJ-Sniffer achieves an accuracy of over 99% with reasonable delays.",

In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we study a general framework for yield farming strategies with empirical analysis. First, we summarize the fundamentals of yield farming by focusing on the protocols and tokens used by aggregators. We then examine the sources of yield and translate those into three example yield farming strategies, followed by the simulations of yield farming performance, based on these strategies. We further compare four major yield aggregators—Idle, Pickle, Harvest and Yearn—in the ecosystem, along with brief introductions of others. We systematize their strategies and revenue models, and conduct an empirical analysis with on-chain data from example vaults, to find a plausible connection between data anomalies and historical events. Finally, we discuss the benefits and risks of yield aggregators.",

In addition to the blockchain, full nodes also store a blockchain-summary, called the state, which is used to efficiently verify transactions. With the size of popular blockchains and their states growing rapidly, full nodes require massive storage resources in order to keep up with the scaling. This leads to a tug-of-war between scaling and decentralization since fewer entities can afford expensive resources. We present hybrid nodes for proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrencies which can validate transactions, validate blocks, validate states, mine, select the main chain, bootstrap new hybrid nodes, and verify payment proofs. With the use of a protocol called trimming, hybrid nodes only retain polylogarithmic number of blocks in the chain length in order to represent the proof-of-work of the blockchain. Hybrid nodes are also optimized for the storage of the state with the use of stateless blockchain protocols. The lowered storage requirements should enable more entities to join as hybrid nodes and improve the decentralization of the system. We define novel theoretical security models for hybrid nodes and show that they are provably secure. We also show that the storage requirement of hybrid nodes is near-optimal with respect to our security definitions.",

    "abstract": "Objective: While existing research by our team has demonstrated the feasibility of building a decentralized identity management application (“MediLinker”) for health information, there are implementation issues related to testing such blockchain-based health applications in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we identified clinical, organizational and regulatory, and ethical and social (CORES) issues, including recommendations, associated with deploying MediLinker, and blockchain in general, for clinical testing. Methods: CORES issues and recommendations were identified through a focus group with 11 academic, industry, and government experts on March 26, 2021. They were grouped according to their expertise: clinical care (n = 4), organizational and regulatory concerns (n = 4), and ethical and social issues (n = 3). The focus group was conducted via Zoom in which experts were briefed about the study aims, formed into breakout groups to identify key issues based on their group’s expertise, and reconvened to share identified issues with other groups and to discuss potential recommendations to address such issues. The focus group was video recorded and transcribed. The resulting transcriptions and meeting notes were imported to MAXQDA 2018 for thematic analysis. Results: Clinical experts identified issues that concern the clinical system, clinical administrators, clinicians, and patients. Organizational and regulatory experts emphasized issues on accountability, compliance, and legal safeguards. Ethics and social-context experts raised issues on trust, transparency, digital divide, and health-related digital autonomy. Accordingly, experts proposed six recommendations that could address most of the identified issues: (1) design interfaces based on patient preferences, (2) ensure testing with diverse populations, (3) ensure compliance with existing policies, (4) present potential positive outcomes to top management, (5) maintain clinical workflow, and (6) increase the public’s awareness of blockchain. Conclusions: This study identified a myriad of CORES issues associated with deploying MediLinker in clinical settings. Moreover, the study also uncovered several recommendations that could address such issues. The findings raise awareness on CORES issues that should be considered when designing, developing, and deploying blockchain for healthcare. Further, the findings provide additional insights into the development of MediLinker from a prototype to a minimum viable product for clinical testing. Future studies can use CORES as a socio-technical model to identify issues and recommendations associated with deploying health information technologies in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Clinical data in the United States are highly fragmented, stored in numerous different databases, and are defined by service providers or clinical specialties rather than by individuals or their families. As a result, linking or aggregating a complete record for a patient is a major technological, legal, and operational challenge. One of the factors that has made clinical data integration so difficult to achieve is the lack of a universal ID for everyone. This leads to other related problems of having to prove identity at each interaction with the health system and repeatedly providing basic information on demographics, insurance, payment, and medical conditions. Traditional solutions that require complex governance, expensive technology, and risks to privacy and security of the data have failed adequately to solve this interoperability problem. We describe the technical design decisions of a patient-centric decentralized health identity management system using the blockchain technology, called MediLinker, to address some of these challenges. Design: Our multidisciplinary research group developed and implemented an identity wallet, which uses the blockchain technology to manage verifiable credentials issued by healthcare clinics, banks, and insurance companies. To manage patient’s self-sovereign identity, we leveraged the Hyperledger Indy blockchain framework to store patient’s decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and the schemas or format for each credential type. In contrast, the credentials containing patient data are stored ‘off-ledger’ in each person’s wallet and accessible via a computer or smartphone. We used Hyperledger Aries as a middleware layer (API: Application Programming Interface) to connect Hyperledger Indy with the front-end, which was developed using a JavaScript framework, ReactJS (Web Application) and React Native (iOS Application). Results: MediLinker allows users to store their personal data on digital wallets, which they control. It uses a decentralized trusted identity using Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries. Patients use MediLinker to register and share their information securely and in a trusted system with healthcare and other service providers. Each MediLinker wallet can have six credential types: health ID with patient demographics, insurance, medication list including COVID-19 vaccination status, credit card, medical power of attorney (MPOA) for guardians of pediatric or geriatric patients, and research consent. The system allows for in-person and remote granting and revoking of such permissions for care, research, or other purposes without repeatedly requiring physical identity documents or enrollment information. Conclusion: We successfully developed and tested a blockchain-based technical architecture, described in this article, as an identity management system that may be operationalized and scaled for future implementation to improve patient experience and control over their personal information.",

    "abstract": "Background: The current healthcare ecosystem in the United States is plagued by inefficiencies in transitions of patient care between healthcare providers due in large part to a lack of interoperability among the many electronic medical record (EMR) systems that exist today. Both providers and patients experience significant frustration due to the negative effects of increased costs, unnecessary administrative burden, and duplication of services that occur because of data fragmentation in the system. Blockchain technology provides a potential solution to mitigate or eliminate these gaps by allowing for exchange of healthcare information that is distributed, auditable, immutable, and respectful of patient autonomy. Our multidisciplinary team identified key tasks required for a transition of care to design and develop a blockchain application, MediLinker, which served as a patient-centric identity management system to address issues of data fragmentation ultimately aiding in the delivery of high-value care services. Methods: The MediLinker application was evaluated for its ability to accomplish various key tasks needed for a successful transition of patient care in an outpatient setting. Our team created 20 unique patient use cases covering a diversity of medical needs and social circumstances that were played out by participants who were asked to perform various tasks as they received case across a simulated healthcare ecosystem composed of four clinics, a research institution, and other ancillary public services. Tasks included, but were not limited to, clinic enrollment, verification of identity, medication reconciliation, sharing insurance and billing information, and updating demographic information. With this iteration of MediLinker, we specifically focused on the functionality of digital guardianship and patient revocation of healthcare information. In addition, throughout the simulation, we surveyed participant perceptions regarding the use of MediLinker and blockchain technology to better ascertain comfortability and usability of the application. Results: Quantitative evaluation of simulation results revealed that MediLinker was able to successfully accomplish all seven clinical scenarios tested across the 20 patient use cases. MediLinker successfully achieved its goal of patient-centered interoperability as participants transitioned their simulated healthcare data, including COVID-19 vaccination status and current medications, across the four clinic sites and research institution. In addition to completing all key tasks designated, all eligible participants were able to enroll with and subsequently revoke data access with our simulated research site. MediLinker had a low data-entry error rate, with most errors occurring due to work-flow vulnerabilities. Our qualitative analysis of user perceptions indicated that comfortability and trust with blockchain technology, such as MediLinker, grew with increased education and exposure to such technology. Conclusions: The ubiquitous problem of data fragmentation in our current healthcare ecosystem has placed considerable strain on providers and patients alike. Blockchain applications for health identity management, such as MediLinker, provide a viable solution to stem the inefficiencies that exist today. The interoperability that MediLinker provided across our simulated healthcare system has the potential to improve transitions of care by sharing key aspects of healthcare information in a timely, secure, and patent-centric fashion allowing for the delivery of consistent and personalized high value care. Blockchain technologies appear to face similar challenges to widespread adoption as other novel interventions, namely recognition, trust, and usability. Further development and scaling are required for such technology to realize its full potential in the real world and transform the practice of modern health care.",

    "abstract": "Fixing bugs is easiest by patching source code. However, source code is not always available: only 0.3% of the ∼49M smart contracts that are currently deployed on Ethereum have their source code pub- licly available. Moreover, since contracts may call functions from other contracts, security flaws in closed-source contracts may affect open-source contracts as well. However, current state-of-the-art approaches that operate on closed-source contracts (i.e., EVM byte- code), such as EVMPatch and SmartShield, make use of purely hard-coded templates that leverage fix patching patterns. As a re- sult, they cannot dynamically adapt to the bytecode that is being patched, which severely limits their flexibility and scalability. For instance, when patching integer overflows using hard-coded tem- plates, a particular patch template needs to be employed as the bounds to be checked are different for each integer size (i.e., one template for uint256, another template for uint64, etc.). In this paper, we propose Elysium, a scalable approach towards automatic smart contract repair at the bytecode level. Elysium com- bines template-based and semantic-based patching by inferring context information from bytecode. Elysium is currently able to patch 7 different types of vulnerabilities in smart contracts auto- matically and can easily be extended with new templates and new bug-finding tools. We evaluate its effectiveness and correctness using 3 different datasets by replaying more than 500K transactions on patched contracts. We find that Elysium outperforms existing tools by patching at least 30% more contracts correctly. Finally, we also compare the overhead of Elysium in terms of deployment and transaction cost. In comparison to other tools, we find that generally Elysium minimizes the runtime cost (i.e., transaction cost) up to a factor of 1.7, for only a marginally higher deployment cost, where deployment cost is a one-time cost as compared to the runtime cost.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain protocols suffer from an interesting conundrum: owning stake in the Blockchain doesn’t necessarily mean that the party is willing to participate in day to day operations. This leads to large quantities of stake being owned by parties who do not actually participate in the growth of the blockchain, reducing its security. Pass and Shi captured this concern in the sleepy model, and subsequent work by Pass et al. extended their results into a full Proof of Stake blockchain protocol which can continue to securely progress even when the majority of parties may be offline. However, their protocol requires 10 or more blocks to be added after a transaction first appears in the ledger for it to be confirmed. On the other hand, existing Byzantine Agreement based blockchain protocols such as Algorand confirm transactions as soon as they appear in the ledger, but are unable to progress when users are not online when mandated. The main question we address is: Do there exist blockchain protocols which can continue to securely progress even when the majority of parties (resp. stake) may be offline, and confirm transactions as soon as they appear in the ledger? Our main result shows the answer to this question to be “yes”. We present a Proof of Stake blockchain protocol which continues to securely progress so long as more than half of the online stake is controlled by honest parties, and instantly confirms transactions upon appearance in the ledger.",

    "abstract": "Programming digital contracts comes with unique challenges, which include (i) expressing and enforcing protocols of interaction, (ii) controlling resource usage, and (iii) preventing the duplication or deletion of a contract's assets. This article presents the design and type-theoretic foundation of Nomos, a programming language for digital contracts that addresses these challenges. To express and enforce protocols, Nomos is based on shared binary session types. To control resource usage, Nomos employs automatic amortized resource analysis. To prevent the duplication or deletion of assets, Nomos uses a linear type system. A monad integrates the effectful session-typed language with a general-purpose functional language. Nomos' prototype implementation features linear-time type checking and efficient type reconstruction that includes automatic inference of resource bounds via off-the-shelf linear optimization. The effectiveness of the language is evaluated with case studies on implementing common smart contracts such as auctions, elections, and currencies. Nomos is completely formalized, including the type system, a cost semantics, and a transactional semantics to deploy Nomos contracts on a blockchain. The type soundness proof ensures that protocols are followed at run-time and that types establish sound upper bounds on the resource consumption, ruling out re-entrancy and out-of-gas vulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "A secret sharing scheme enables one party to distribute shares of a secret to n parties and ensures that an adversary in control of t out of n parties will learn no information about the secret. However, traditional secret sharing schemes are often insufficient, especially for applications in which the set of parties who hold the secret shares might change over time. To achieve security in this setting, dynamic proactive secret sharing (DPSS) is used. DPSS schemes proactively update the secret shares held by the parties and allow changes to the set of parties holding the secrets. We propose FaB-DPSS (FAst Batched DPSS) – a new and highly optimized batched DPSS scheme. While previous work on batched DPSS [BDLO15] focuses on a single client submitting a batch of secrets and does not allow storing and releasing secrets independently, we allow multiple different clients to dynamically share and release secrets. FaB-DPSS is the most efficient robust DPSS scheme that supports the highest possible adversarial threshold of 12. We prove FaB-DPSS secure and implement it. All operations complete in seconds, and we outperform a prior state-of-the-art DPSS scheme [MZW+19] by over 6×. Additionally, we propose new applications of DPSS in the context of blockchains. Specifically, we propose a protocol that uses blockchains and FaB-DPSS to provide conditional secret storage. The protocol allows parties to store secrets along with a release condition, and once a (possibly different) party satisfies this release condition, the secret is privately released to that party. This functionality is similar to extractable witness encryption. While there are numerous compelling applications (e.g., time-lock encryption, one-time programs, and fair multi-party computation) which rely on extractable witness encryption, there are no known efficient constructions (or even constructions based on any well-studied assumptions) of extractable witness encryption. However, by utilizing blockchains and FaB-DPSS, we can easily build all those applications. We provide an implementation of our conditional secret storage protocol as well as several applications building on top of it.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies offer an appealing alternative to Fiat currencies, due to their decentralized and borderless nature. However the decentralized settings make the authentication process more challenging: Standard cryptographic methods often rely on the ability of users to reliably store a (large) secret information. What happens if one user's key is lost or stolen? Blockchain systems lack of fallback mechanisms that allow one to recover from such an event, whereas the traditional banking system has developed and deploys quite effective solutions. In this work, we develop new cryptographic techniques to integrate security policies (developed in the traditional banking domain) in the blockchain settings. We propose a system where a smart contract is given the custody of the user's funds and has the ability to invoke a two-factor authentication (2FA) procedure in case of an exceptional event (e.g., a particularly large transaction or a key recovery request). To enable this, the owner of the account secret-shares the answers of some security questions among a committee of users. When the 2FA mechanism is triggered, the committee members can provide the smart contract with enough information to check whether an attempt was successful, and nothing more. We then design a protocol that securely and efficiently implements such a functionality: The protocol is round-optimal, is robust to the corruption of a subset of committee members, supports low-entropy secrets, and is concretely efficient. As a stepping stone towards the design of this protocol, we introduce a new threshold homomorphic encryption scheme for linear predicates from bilinear maps, which might be of independent interest. To substantiate the practicality of our approach, we implement the above protocol as a smart contract in Ethereum and show that it can be used today as an additional safeguard for suspicious transactions, at minimal added cost. We also implement a second scheme where the smart contract additionally requests a signature from a physical hardware token, whose verification key is registered upfront by the owner of the funds. We show how to integrate the widely used universal two-factor authentication (U2F) tokens in blockchain environments, thus enabling the deployment of our system with available hardware.",

Through the proposed DBACP-IoTSG, the data is securely brought to the service providers from their respective smart meters (SMs). The peer-to-peer (P2P) network is formed by the participating service providers, where the peer nodes are responsible for creating the blocks from the gathered data securely from their corresponding SMs and adding them into the blockchain after validation of the blocks using the voting-based consensus algorithm. In our work, the blockchain is considered as private because the data collected from the consumers of the SMs are private and confidential. By the formal security analysis under the random oracle model, nonmathematical security analysis and software-based formal security verification, DBACP-IoTSG is shown to be resistant against various attacks. We carry out the experimental results of various cryptographic primitives that are needed for comparative analysis using the widely used multiprecision integer and rational arithmetic cryptographic library (MIRACL). A detailed comparative study reveals that DBACP-IoTSG supports more functionality features and provides better security apart from its low communication and computation costs as compared to recently proposed relevant schemes. In addition, the blockchain implementation of DBACP-IoTSG has been performed to measure computational time needed for the varied number of blocks addition and also the varied number of transactions per block in the blockchain.",

Therefore, human assistance is critical if current automatic fake new identification technologies desire to improve accuracy. Given this situation, prior research has proposed to add a quorum, a group of appraisers trusted by users to verify the authenticity of the information, to the fake news prevention systems. This paper proposes a stake-based incentive mechanism to diminish the negative effect of malicious behaviors on a quorum-based fake news prevention system. Moreover, we use Hyperledger Fabric, Schnorr signatures, and human appraisers to implement a practical prototype of a quorum-based fake news prevention system. Then we conduct necessary case analyses and experiments to realize how dishonest participants, crash failures, and scale impact our system. The outcomes of the case analyses and experiments show that our mechanisms are feasible and provide an analytical basis for developing fake news prevention systems.",

    "abstract": "Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains add blocks, and consequently the chain weight, randomly. The blocks added also have a significant network delay owing to their large size. Large delay combined with randomness causes forks that are responsible for many security problems. One can reduce fork occurrences by designing a system with large block intervals and size but this design compromises performance aspects such as confirmation time guarantees. The trade-off between security and performance in PoW blockchain is a well discussed topic in the literature. In this paper, we aim to reduce the conflict between security and performance through our novel concept of Links. Links are small, fast and frequent structures that can be incorporated on any new or existing PoW blockchains. Links help reduce the confirmation time of its underlying blockchain while preserving its consistency security guarantees. Our novel lower-bound growth rate for PoW systems with links in the presence of a general adversary in a partially synchronous network, shows that links provide a more steady chain growth rate than classic PoW systems without links. On a well-established, secure system like Bitcoin, we use the derived growth rate to show that when links are incorporated to Bitcoin, they help reduce its confirmation time from 60 minutes by half to 30 minutes, while retaining the consistency threshold guarantees of the original Bitcoin system. We provide a proof of concept emulation of links in a Bitcoin test bed consisting of 210 nodes having real world latencies between them. We benchmark a system with links against Bitcoin to show links cause negligible network overheads and no compromises on security in terms of orphaned weight due to forks. Our theoretical analyses and experiments can easily be extended to other Nakamoto style PoW systems.",

    "abstract": "To achieve interoperability between unconnected ledgers, hash time lock contracts (HTLCs) are commonly used for cross-chain asset exchange. The solution tolerates transaction failure, and can “make the best out of worst” by allowing transacting agents to at least keep their original assets in case of an abort. Nonetheless, as an undesired outcome, reoccurring transaction failures prompt a critical and analytical examination of the protocol. In this study, we propose a game-theoretic framework to study the strategic behaviors of agents taking part in cross-chain atomic swaps implemented with HTLCs. We study the success rate of the transaction as a function of the exchange rate of the swap, the token price and its volatility, among other variables. We demonstrate that in an attempt to maximize one's own utility as asset price changes, either agent might withdraw from the swap. An extension of our model confirms that collateral deposits can improve the transaction success rate, motivating further research towards collateralization without a trusted third party. A second model variation suggests that a swap is more likely to succeed when agents dynamically adjust the exchange rate in response to price fluctuations.",

Our main theorem proves that this embedding maintains all safety and liveness properties of ℘.

DLT systems building on alternative consensus mechanisms, particularly proof-of-stake (PoS), aim to address this downside. In this paper, we take an initial step towards comparing the energy requirements of such systems to understand whether they achieve this goal equally well. While multiple studies have analysed the energy demands of individual blockchains, little comparative work has been done. We approach this research gap by formalising a basic consumption model for PoS blockchains. Applying this model to six archetypal blockchains generates three main findings. First, we confirm the concerns around the energy footprint of PoW by showing that Bitcoin's energy consumption exceeds the energy consumption of all PoS-based systems analysed by at least three orders of magnitude. Second, we illustrate that there are significant differences in energy consumption among the PoS-based systems analysed, with permissionless systems having a larger energy footprint overall owing to their higher replication factor. Third, we point out that the type of hardware that validators use has a considerable impact on whether the energy consumption of PoS blockchains is comparable with or considerably larger than that of centralised systems.",

    "abstract": "Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are receiving more attention than ever before. Yet the motivations for issuance vary across countries, as do the policy approaches and technical designs. As yet, no major jurisdiction has launched a CBDC, and many open questions remain. Monetary authorities, fearful of being left behind by innovations in the private sector, have increasingly turned from observers into participants. This book brings together contributions from academics and experts from monetary authorities and international organisations to provide a detailed and insightful overview of the key considerations of current CBDC developments worldwide. Specific chapters discuss the economic, legal and political implications of CBDC implementation, as well as assessing existing initiatives and reflecting on the future of the digital financial landscape. What is clear from the research is that there are no ‘right’ choices for monetary authorities when considering CBDC. However, the debate has clearly narrowed and the implications are now better understood, with issues of privacy, politics and information increasingly coming to the fore. Concerns have also broadened beyond the domains of payments, monetary policy and financial stability, which have generated a consensus that parliaments and voters – not just central banks – should actively join the debate. The book is an output from CEPR’s Research and Policy Network on FinTech and Digital Currencies, which was established in 2018 to generate, coordinate and disseminate impactful research about the optimal policies to deal with these fast-moving changes in financial markets. The eBook provides a useful guide for policymakers to navigate the complex and fast-moving world of financial digitalisation and should help to inform the design of pilot projects and the direction of future research. CEPR is grateful to Dirk Niepelt for his expert editorship of this eBook. Our thanks also go to Anil Shamdasani for his skilled handling of its production, and to Kirsty McNeill for her contributions towards its production. CEPR, which takes no institutional positions on economic policy matters, is delighted to provide a platform for an exchange of views on this important topic.",

The paper’s framework of analysis combines the Diamond (1965) model of government debt with the Klein (1971) and Monti (1972) model of a monopoly bank. The paper finds that the introduction of a central bank digital currency has no detrimental effect on bank lending activity and may, in some circumstances, even serve to promote it. Competitive pressure leads to a higher monopoly deposit rate which reduces profit but expands deposit funding through greater financial inclusion and desired saving. An appeal to available theory and evidence suggests that a properly designed central bank digital currency is not likely to threaten financial stability.",

    "abstract": "Financial speculators often seek to increase their potential gains with leverage. Debt is a popular form of leverage, and with over 39.88B USD of total value locked (TVL), the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending markets are thriving. Debts, however, entail the risks of liquidation, the process of selling the debt collateral at a discount to liquidators. Nevertheless, few quantitative insights are known about the existing liquidation mechanisms. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the breadth of the borrowing and lending markets of the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. We focus on Aave, Compound, MakerDAO, and dYdX, which collectively represent over 85% of the lending market on Ethereum. Given extensive liquidation data measurements and insights, we systematize the prevalent liquidation mechanisms and are the first to provide a methodology to compare them objectively. We find that the existing liquidation designs well incentivize liquidators but sell excessive amounts of discounted collateral at the borrowers' expenses. We measure various risks that liquidation participants are exposed to and quantify the instabilities of existing lending protocols. Moreover, we propose an optimal strategy that allows liquidators to increase their liquidation profit, which may aggravate the loss of borrowers.",

    "abstract": "Trust is a key resource in financial transactions. Traditional financial institutions, and novel blockchain-based decentralized financial services (DeFi) rely on fundamentally different sources of trust and confidence. The former relies on heavy regulation, trusted intermediaries, clear rules (and restrictions) on market competition, and long standing informal expectations on what banks and other financial intermediaries are supposed to do or not to do. The latter rely on blockchain technology to provide confidence in the outcome of rules encoded in protocols and smart contracts. Their main promise is to create confidence in the way the blockchain architecture enforces rules, rather than to trust banks, regulators, markets. In this article, we compare the trust architectures surrounding these two financial systems. We provide a deeper analysis of how proposed regulation in the blockchain space affects the code- and confidence-based architectures which so far have underwrote DeFi. We argue that despite the solid safeguards and guarantees which code can offer, the confidence in DeFi is still very much dependent on more traditional trust-enhancing mechanisms, such as code governance, and anti-fraud regulation to address some of the issues which currently plague this domain, and which have no immediate, purely software-based solutions. What is more, given the risks of bugs or scams in the DeFi space, regulation and trusted intermediaries may need to play a more active role, in order for DeFi to gain the trust of the next generation of users.",

    "abstract": "Credit allows a lender to loan out surplus capital to a borrower. In the traditional economy, credit bears the risk that the borrower may default on its debt, the lender hence requires upfront collateral from the borrower, plus interest fee payments. Due to the atomicity of blockchain transactions, lenders can offer flash loans, i.e., loans that are only valid within one transaction and must be repaid by the end of that transaction. This concept has lead to a number of interesting attack possibilities, some of which were exploited in February 2020. This paper is the first to explore the implication of transaction atomicity and flash loans for the nascent decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. We show quantitatively how transaction atomicity increases the arbitrage revenue. We moreover analyze two existing attacks with ROIs beyond 500k%. We formulate finding the attack parameters as an optimization problem over the state of the underlying Ethereum blockchain and the state of the DeFi ecosystem. We show how malicious adversaries can efficiently maximize an attack profit and hence damage the DeFi ecosystem further. Specifically, we present how two previously executed attacks can be “boosted” to result in a profit of  829.5k USD and 1.1M USD, respectively, which is a boost of 2.37× and 1.73×, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a blockchain-assetenabled finance ecosystem with millions of daily USD transaction volume, billions of locked up USD, as well as a plethora of newly emerging protocols (for lending, staking, and exchanges). Because all transactions, user balances, and total value locked in DeFi are publicly readable, a natural question that arises is: how can we automatically craft profitable transactions across the intertwined DeFi platforms? In this paper, we investigate two methods that allow us to automatically create profitable DeFi trades, one well-suited to arbitrage and the other applicable to more complicated settings. We first adopt the Bellman-Ford-Moore algorithm with DEFIPOSERARB and then create logical DeFi protocol models for a theorem prover in DEFIPOSER-SMT. While DEFIPOSER-ARB focuses on DeFi transactions that form a cycle and performs very well for arbitrage, DEFIPOSER-SMT can detect more complicated profitable transactions. We estimate that DEFIPOSER-ARB and DEFIPOSER-SMT can generate an average weekly revenue of 191.48 ETH (76,592 USD) and 72.44 ETH (28,976 USD) respectively, with the highest transaction revenue being 81.31 ETH (32,524 USD) and 22.40 ETH (8,960 USD) respectively. We further show that DEFIPOSER-SMT finds the known economic bZx attack from February 2020, which yields 0.48M USD. Our forensic investigations show that this opportunity existed for 69 days and could have yielded more revenue if exploited one day earlier. Our evaluation spans 150 days, given 96 DeFi protocol actions, and 25 assets. Looking beyond the financial gains mentioned above, forks deteriorate the blockchain consensus security, as they increase the risks of double-spending and selfish mining. We explore the implications of DEFIPOSER-ARB and DEFIPOSER-SMT on blockchain consensus. Specifically, we show that the trades identified by our tools exceed the Ethereum block reward by up to 874×. Given optimal adversarial strategies provided by a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we quantify the value threshold at which a profitable transaction qualifies as Miner Extractable Value (MEV) and would incentivize MEV-aware miners to fork the blockchain. For instance, we find that on Ethereum, a miner with a hash rate of 10% would fork the blockchain if an MEV opportunity exceeds 4× the block reward.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) allow parties to participate in financial markets while retaining full custody of their funds. However, the transparency of blockchain-based DEX in combination with the latency for transactions to be processed, makes market-manipulation feasible. For instance, adversaries could perform front-running — the practice of exploiting (typically non-public) information that may change the price of an asset for financial gain. In this work we formalize, analytically exposit and empirically evaluate an augmented variant of frontrunning: sandwich attacks, which involve front- and back-running victim transactions on a blockchain-based DEX. We quantify the probability of an adversarial trader being able to undertake the attack, based on the relative positioning of a transaction within a blockchain block. We find that a single adversarial trader can earn a daily revenue of over several thousand USD when performing sandwich attacks on one particular DEX — Uniswap, an exchange with over 5M USD daily trading volume by June 2020. In addition to a single-adversary game, we simulate the outcome of sandwich attacks under multiple competing adversaries, to account for the real-world trading environment.",

However, current techniques rely on heuristics that have not been rigorously evaluated or optimized. In this paper, we tackle several challenges of change address identification and clustering. First, we build a ground truth set of transactions with known change from the Bitcoin blockchain that can be used to validate the efficacy of individual change address detection heuristics. Equipped with this data set, we develop new techniques to predict change outputs with low false positive rates. After applying our prediction model to the Bitcoin blockchain, we analyze the resulting clustering and develop ways to detect and prevent cluster collapse. Finally, we assess the impact our enhanced clustering has on two exemplary applications.",

We sampled 259 phone numbers available to new subscribers at two major carriers, and found that 171 of them were tied to existing accounts at popular websites, potentially allowing those accounts to be hijacked. Additionally, a majority of available numbers led to hits on people search services, which provide personally identifiable information on previous owners. Furthermore, a significant fraction (100 of 259) of the numbers were linked to leaked login credentials on the web, which could enable account hijackings that defeat SMS-based multi-factor authentication. We also found design weaknesses in carriers’ online interfaces and number recycling policies that could facilitate attacks involving number recycling. We close by recommending steps carriers, websites, and subscribers can take to reduce risk.",

    "abstract": "Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act authorizes U.S. intelligence agencies to intercept communications content without obtaining a warrant. While Section 702 requires targeting foreigners abroad for intelligence purposes, agencies “incidentally” collect communications to or from Americans and can search that data for purposes beyond intelligence gathering. For over a decade, members of Congress and civil society organizations have called on the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) to estimate the scale of incidental collection. Senior intelligence officials have acknowledged the value of quantitative transparency for incidental collection, but the IC has not identified a satisfactory estimation method that respects individual privacy, protects intelligence sources and methods, and imposes minimal burden on IC resources. In this work, we propose a novel approach to estimating incidental collection using secure multiparty computation (MPC). The IC possesses records about the parties to intercepted communications, and communications services possess country-level location for users. By combining these datasets with MPC, it is possible to generate an automated aggregate estimate of incidental collection that maintains confidentiality for intercepted communications and user locations. We formalize our proposal as a new variant of private set intersection, which we term multiparty private set intersection with union and sum (MPSIU-Sum). We then design and evaluate an efficient MPSIU-Sum protocol, based on elliptic curve cryptography and partially homomorphic encryption. Our protocol performs well at the large scale necessary for estimating incidental collection in Section 702 surveillance.",

The predominant approach at present, perceptual hash matching, is not viable because in E2EE a communications service cannot access user content. In this work, we explore the technical feasibility of privacy-preserving perceptual hash matching for E2EE services. We begin by formalizing the problem space and identifying fundamental limitations for protocols. Next, we evaluate the predictive performance of common perceptual hash functions to understand privacy risks to E2EE users and contextualize errors associated with the protocols we design. Our primary contribution is a set of constructions for privacy-preserving perceptual hash matching. We design and evaluate client-side constructions for scenarios where disclosing the set of harmful hashes is acceptable. We then design and evaluate interactive protocols that optionally protect the hash set and do not disclose matches to users. The constructions that we propose are practical for deployment on mobile devices and introduce a limited additional risk of false negatives.",

    "abstract": "Cryptographic Self-Selection is a subroutine used to select a leader for modern proof-of-stake consensus protocols. In cryptographic self-selection, each round r has a seed Qr. In round r, each account owner is asked to digitally sign Qr, hash their digital signature to produce a credential, and then broadcast this credential to the entire network. A publicly-known function scores each credential in a manner so that the distribution of the lowest scoring credential is identical to the distribution of stake owned by each account. The user who broadcasts the lowest-scoring credential is the leader for round r, and their credential becomes the seed Qr+1. Such protocols leave open the possibility of manipulation: a user who owns multiple accounts that each produce low-scoring credentials in round r can selectively choose which ones to broadcast in order to influence the seed for round r+1. Indeed, the user can pre-compute their credentials for round r+1 for each potential seed, and broadcast only the credential (among those with low enough score to be leader) that produces the most favorable seed. We consider an adversary who wishes to maximize the expected fraction of rounds in which an account they own is the leader. We show such an adversary always benefits from deviating from the intended protocol, regardless of the fraction of the stake controlled. We characterize the optimal strategy; first by proving the existence of optimal positive recurrent strategies whenever the adversary owns last than 3-5/2 ~38% of the stake. Then, we provide a Markov Decision Process formulation to compute the optimal strategy.",

    "abstract": "Blockchains ensure integrity, transparency, and immutability of transactions they process. It also guarantees the eventual inclusion of all the transactions submitted to the blockchain and records them in its ledger. Bitcoin and Litecoin are examples of time-tested, reliable public blockchains that handle only one type of transaction – send/receive money (i.e., transfer-of-value) from one user to another. Whereas, general-purpose blockchains like Ethereum provide means and methods to encapsulate transfer of not only value but anything fungible that can be digitally represented with the help of programs aka smart contracts. However, with a high-level Turing-complete programming language to write smart contracts, Ethereum encountered vulnerabilities in its contracts thus forgoing the claim of immutability. On the contrary, script-based blockchains like Bitcoin and Litecoin have withstood the test of time and hence are perceived reliable – a very important aspect while managing assets like land. In this paper, we present a transfer-of-asset system for land management that borrows from Litecoin protocol its script, underlying consensus, and block structure. Our resultant system is a permissioned blockchain, where only a set of pre-approved miners can append land records to the blockchain. We introduce sidechains that are roped in a mainchain. The mainchain stores land records, which can be queried by citizens; whereas, sidechains hold intricate details about intermediate validations performed by regulators, registrars, and notaries. The process of land management used in this paper is a typical process in the states of India. Our system can be used to manage any asset class that is finite in nature. Our approach provides transparency of transactions at a higher level and privacy to individual transactions.",

    "abstract": "Proof-of-Work (PoW) based blockchains typically allocate only a tiny fraction (e.g., less than 1% for Ethereum) of the average interarrival time (I) between blocks for validating smart contracts present in transactions. In such systems, block validation and PoW mining are typically performed sequentially, the former by CPUs and the latter by ASICs. A trivial increase in validation time (τ) introduces the popularly known Verifier's Dilemma, and as we demonstrate, causes more forking and hurts fairness. Large τ also reduces the tolerance for safety against a Byzantine adversary. Solutions that offload validation to a set of non-chain nodes (a.k.a. off-chain approaches) suffer from trust and performance issues that are non-trivial to resolve. In this paper, we present Tuxedo, the first on-chain protocol to theoretically scale τ/I ≈1 in PoW blockchains. The key innovation in Tuxedo is to perform CPU-based block processing in parallel to ASIC mining. We achieve this by allowing miners to delay validation of transactions in a block by up to ζ blocks, where ζ is a system parameter. We perform security analysis of Tuxedo considering all possible adversarial strategies in a synchronous network with maximum end-to-end delay Δ and demonstrate that Tuxedo achieves security equivalent to known results for longest chain PoW Nakamoto consensus. Our prototype implementation of Tuxedo atop Ethereum demonstrates that it can scale τ without suffering the harmful effects of naive scaling up of τ/I in existing blockchains",

    "abstract": "Ever since databases became an ubiquitous part of enterprises or businesses, security and privacy became a requirement. Traditionally, privacy was realized through various methods of database access control and relied much on the use of statically defined views, which are essentially logical constructs imposed over database tables that can alter or restrict the data that can be viewed by an user. Privacy is about the responsible maintenance of private information. This responsibility is hard to define, which is why laws are necessary. With a vast accumulation of personal data in databases, there has been a heightened awareness and concern about the storage and use of private information leading to privacy-related guidelines, regulations and legislations, Compliance with these regulations has become one of the major concerns for organizations and companies. Traditionally, privacy in databases (DBs) have been addressed through access control techniques including multi-level security (MLS) based on mandatory access control (MAC), and restricted views to the users. As view definitions to comply with regulations became quite complex for accommodating all the restrictions in one view, explicit constructs for specifying privacy policies were introduced for complying with medical regulations like HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) from USA, in relational database systems. These enabled fine grained access control (FGAC) capable of enforcing disclosure control enunciated databases. Application of information flow control that is needed for multi-level security (MLS) databases to preserve privacy among multiple users but have their challenges like new abstractions for managing information flow in a relational database system, handling transactions and integrity constraints without introducing covert channels etc. As the DBs need to work alongside information flow controlled programming languages and operating systems for tracking flows, there is a need to enforce the security policy not only on the DBMS but also on the application platform. Due to the underlying requirement of decentralization, it calls for declassification/endorsement and santization requirements on the DB. In this paper, we shall first review some of the major privacy enhancing techniques used traditionally for DBs including MLS DBs, and then explore application of decentralized information flow control models for realizing information flow secure DBs in a robust manner. Towards the end, we shall also touch upon some of the roles of anonymization and psuedonymization including inference control and differential privacy in realizing privacy in practice.",

    "abstract": "In order for resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices to set up secure communication channels to exchange confidential messages, Symmetric Key Cryptography (SKC) is usually preferred to resource-intensive Public Key Cryptography (PKC). At the core of setting up a secure channel is secure key exchange, the process of two IoT devices securely agreeing on a common session key before they communicate. While compared to using PKC, key exchange using SKC is more resource-aware for IoT environments, it requires either a pre-shared secret or trusted intermediaries between the two devices; neither assumption is realistic in IoT. In this paper, we relax the above assumptions and introduce a new intermediary-based secure key exchange protocol for IoT devices that do not support PKC. With a design that is lightweight and deployable in IoT, our protocol fundamentally departs from existing intermediary-based solutions in that (1) it leverages intermediary parties that can be malicious and (2) it can detect malicious intermediary parties. We provide a formal proof that our protocol is secure and conduct a theoretical analysis to show the failure probability of our protocol is easily negligible with a reasonable setup and its malicious helper detection probability can be 1.0 even when a malicious helper only tampers a small number of messages. We implemented our protocol and our experimental results show that our protocol significantly improves the computation time and energy cost. Dependent on the IoT device type (Raspberry Pi, Arduino Due, or Sam D21) and the PKC algorithms to compare against (ECDH, DH, or RSA), our protocol is 2.3 to 1591 times faster on one of the two devices and 0.7 to 4.67 times faster on the other.",

Different from traditional TA, FGTA approaches are usually based on machine learning or high-dimensional clustering, enabling them to discover subtle differences between different network traffic sets. Nowadays, with the increasingly complex Internet architecture, the increasingly frequent transmission of user data, and the widespread use of traffic encryption, FGTA is becoming an essential tool for both network administrators and attackers to gain different levels of visibility over the network. It plays a critical role in intrusion and anomaly detection, quality of experience investigation, user activity inference, website fingerprinting, location estimation, etc. To help scholars and developers research and advance this technology, in this report, we examine the literature that deals with FGTA, investigating the frontier developments in this domain. By comprehensively surveying different approaches toward FGTA, we introduce their input traffic data, elaborate on their operating principles by different use cases, indicate their limitations and countermeasures, and raise several promising future research avenues.",

    "abstract": "Network telemetry systems provide critical visibility into the state of networks. While significant progress has been made by leveraging programmable switch hardware to scale these systems to high and time-varying traffic workloads, less attention has been paid towards efficiently utilizing limited hardware resources in the face of dynamics such as the composition of traffic as well as the number and types of queries running at a given point in time. Both these dynamics have implications on resource requirements and query accuracy. In this paper, we argue that this dynamics problem motivates reframing telemetry systems as resource schedulers---a significant departure from state-of-the-art. More concretely, rather than statically partition queries across hardware and software platforms, telemetry systems ought to decide on their own and at runtime when and for how long to execute the set of active queries on the data plane. To this end, we propose an efficient approximation and scheduling algorithm that exposes accuracy and latency tradeoffs with respect to query execution to reduce hardware resource usage. We evaluate our algorithm by building DynATOS, a hardware prototype built around a reconfigurable approach to ASIC programming. We show that our approach is more robust than state-of-the-art methods to traffic dynamics and can execute dynamic workloads comprised of multiple concurrent and sequential queries of varied complexities on a single switch while meeting per-query accuracy and latency goals.",

    "abstract": "With the ever-increasing use of web APIs in modern- day applications, it is becoming more important to test the system as a whole. In the last decade, tools and approaches have been proposed to automate the creation of system-level test cases for these APIs using evolutionary algorithms (EAs). One of the limiting factors of EAs is that the genetic operators (crossover and mutation) are fully randomized, potentially breaking promising patterns in the sequences of API requests discovered during the search. Breaking these patterns has a negative impact on the effectiveness of the test case generation process. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a new approach that uses Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) to infer a linkage tree model, which captures, replicates, and preserves these patterns in new test cases. We evaluate our approach, called LT-MOSA, by performing an empirical study on 7 real-world benchmark applications w.r.t. branch coverage and real-fault detection capability. We also compare LT-MOSA with the two existing state-of-the-art white-box techniques (MIO, MOSA) for REST API testing. Our results show that LT-MOSA achieves a statistically significant increase in test target coverage (i.e., lines and branches) compared to MIO and MOSA in 4 and 5 out of 7 applications, respectively. Furthermore, LT-MOSA discovers 27 and 18 unique real-faults that are left undetected by MIO and MOSA, respectively.",

Automated Test Case Generation (TCG) can assist developers by speeding up this process. It accomplishes this by evolving an initial set of randomly generated test cases over time to optimize for predefined coverage criteria. One of the key challenges for automated TCG approaches is navigating the large input space. Existing state-of-the-art TCG algorithms struggle with generating highly-structured input data and preserving patterns in test structures, among others. I hypothesize that combining multiple tribes of AI can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of automated TCG. To test this hypothesis, I propose using grammar-based fuzzing and machine learning to augment evolutionary algorithms for generating more structured input data and preserving promising patterns within test cases. Additionally, I propose to use behavioral modeling and interprocedural control dependency analysis to improve test effectiveness. Finally, I propose integrating these novel approaches into a testing framework to promote the adoption of automated TCG in industry.",

    "abstract": "A key idea in many-objective optimization is to approximate the optimal Pareto front using a set of representative non-dominated solutions. The produced solution set should be close to the optimal front (convergence) and well-diversified (diversity). Recent studies have shown that measuring both convergence and diversity depends on the shape (or curvature) of the Pareto front. In recent years, researchers have proposed evolutionary algorithms that model the shape of the non-dominated front to define environmental selection strategies that adapt to the underlying geometry. This paper proposes a novel method for non-dominated front modeling using the Newton-Raphson iterative method for roots finding. Second, we compute the distance (diversity) between each pair of non-dominated solutions using geodesics, which are generalizations of the distance on Riemann manifolds (curved topological spaces). We have introduced an evolutionary algorithm within the Adaptive Geometry Estimation based MOEA (AGE-MOEA) framework, which we called AGE-MOEA-II. Computational experiments with 17 problems from the WFG and SMOP benchmarks show that AGE-MOEA-II outperforms its predecessor AGE-MOEA as well as other state-of-the-art many-objective algorithms, i.e., NSGA-III, MOEA/D, VaEA, and LMEA.",

    "abstract": "Transaction-reverting statements are key constructs within Solidity that are extensively used for authority and validity checks. Current state-of-the-art search-based testing and fuzzing approaches do not explicitly handle these statements and therefore can not effectively detect security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we argue that it is critical to directly handle and test these statements to assess that they correctly protect the contracts against invalid requests. To this aim, we propose a new approach that improves the search guidance for these transaction-reverting statements based on interprocedural control dependency analysis, in addition to the traditional coverage criteria. We assess the benefits of our approach by performing an empirical study on 100 smart contracts w.r.t. transaction-reverting statement coverage and vulnerability detection capability. Our results show that the proposed approach can improve the performance of DynaMOSA, the state-of-the-art algorithm for test case generation. On average, we improve transaction-reverting statement coverage by 14 % (up to 35 %), line coverage by 8 % (up to 32 %), and vulnerability-detection capability by 17 % (up to 50 %).",

    "abstract": "Payment channel networks (PCN) enable scalable blockchain transactions without fundamentally changing the underlying distributed ledger algorithm. However, routing a payment via multiple channels in a PCN requires locking collateral for potentially long periods of time. Adversaries can abuse this mechanism to conduct denial-of-service attacks. Previous work focused on source routing, which is unlikely to remain a viable routing approach as these networks grow. In this work, we examine the effectiveness of attacks in PCNs that use routing algorithms based on local knowledge, where compromised intermediate nodes can delay or drop transactions to create denial-of-service. We focus on SpeedyMurmurs as a representative of such protocols. We identify two attacker node selection strategies; one based on the position in the routing tree, and the other on between-ness centrality. Our simulation-driven study shows that while they are both effective, the centrality-based attack approaches near-optimal effectiveness. We also show that the attacks are ineffective in less centralized networks and discuss incentives for the participants in PCNs to create less centralized topologies through the payment channels they establish among themselves.",

    "abstract": "Lightning Network, the off-chain solution to Bitcoin, uses a combination of source routing, layered encryption and conditional commitments to perform anonymous and atomic multi-hop off-chain payments. The three predominant routing clients used in Lightning - LND, c- Lightning and Eclair - differ in their cost functions for adding channels to a payment path and hence result in differ paths. At the moment, there is no detailed study on how the different path selections affect the quality of the payment in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Such an evaluation is needed to i) allow users to make informed choices of which client to use, and ii) enable developers of new routing algorithms to take lessons learned from the current designs into account. In this work, we analyze and compare the three predominant routing clients used by Lightning in terms of the path length, maximal delays a payment might experience, fee borne by the sender and success rate of multi-hop transactions. Based on our experiments and results, we recommend LND for users desiring payments with short paths and high success rates, c- Lightning for users desiring paths with low maximal latencies, and Eclair for those looking for cheap paths in terms of fees paid to the nodes that route payments as intermediaries. We further give guidelines for the design of future routing algorithms based on our insights gained from Lightning's current routing.",

    "abstract": "Payment channels networks drastically increase the throughput and hence scalability of blockchains by performing transactions off-chain. Hence, they are a promising substrate for all decentralized applications that require instant payments. In an off-chain payment, parties deposit coins in a channel and then perform transactions without invoking the global consensus mechanism of the blockchain. However, the transaction value is limited by the capacity of the channel, i.e., the amount of funds available on a channel. These funds decrease when a transaction is sent and increase when a transaction is received on the channel. Recent research indicates that there is an imbalance between sending and receiving transactions, which leads to channel depletion in the sense that one of these operations becomes impossible over time due to the lack of available funds. We incentivize the balanced use of payment channels through fees. Whereas the current fee model depends solely on the transaction value, our fee policies encourage transactions that have a positive effect on the balance in a channel and discourage those that have a negative effect. This paper first defines necessary properties of fee strategies. Then, it introduces two novel fees strategies that provably satisfy all necessary properties. Our extensive simulation study reveals that these incentives increase the effectiveness of payments by 8% to 19%.",

    "abstract": "Lightning, the prevailing solution to Bitcoin’s scalability issue, uses onion routing to hide senders and recipients of payments. Yet, the path between the sender and the recipient along which payments are routed is selected such that it is short, cost efficient, and fast. The low degree of randomness in the path selection entails that anonymity sets are small. However, quantifying the anonymity provided by Lightning is challenging due to the existence of multiple implementations that differ with regard to the path selection algorithm and exist in parallel within the network. In this paper, we propose a general method allowing a local internal attacker to determine sender and recipient anonymity sets. Based on an in-depth code review of three Lightning implementations, we analyze how an adversary can predict the sender and the recipient of a multi-hop transaction. Our simulations indicate that only one adversarial node on a payment path uniquely identifies at least one of sender and recipient for around 70% of the transactions observed by the adversary. Moreover, multiple colluding attackers can almost always identify sender and receiver uniquely.",

    "abstract": "An adaptor signature can be viewed as a signature concealed with a secret value and, by design, any two of the trio yield the other. In a multiparty setting, an initial adaptor signature allows each party to create additional adaptor signatures without the original secret. Adaptor signatures help address scalability and interoperability issues in blockchain. They can also bring some important advantages to cryptocurrencies, such as low on-chain cost, improved transaction fungibility, and fewer limitations of a blockchain’s scripting language. In this paper, we propose a new two-party adaptor signature scheme that relies on quantum-safe hard problems in coding theory. The proposed scheme uses a hash-and-sign code-based signature scheme introduced by Debris-Alazard et al. and a code-based hard relation defined from the well-known syndrome decoding problem. To achieve all the basic properties of adaptor signatures formalized by Aumayr et al., we introduce further modifications to the aforementioned signature scheme. We also give a security analysis of our scheme and its application to the atomic swap. After providing a set of parameters for our scheme, we show that it has the smallest pre-signature size compared to existing post-quantum adaptor signatures.",

    "abstract": "This work addresses the problem of verifying imperative programs that manipulate data structures, e.g., Rust programs. Data structures are usually modeled by Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) in verification conditions. Inductive invariants of such programs often require recursively defined functions (RDFs) to represent abstractions of data structures. From the logic perspective, this reduces to solving Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) modulo both ADT and RDF. The underlying logic with RDFs is undecidable. Thus, even verifying a candidate inductive invariant is undecidable. Similarly, IC3-based algorithms for solving CHCs lose their progress guarantee: they may not find counterexamples when the program is unsafe. We propose a novel IC3-inspired algorithm Racer for solving CHCs modulo ADT and RDF (i.e., automatically synthesizing inductive invariants, as opposed to only verifying them as is done in deductive verification). Racer ensures progress despite the undecidability of the underlying theory, and is guaranteed to terminate with a counterexample for unsafe programs. It works with a general class of RDFs over ADTs called catamorphisms. The key idea is to represent catamorphisms as both CHCs, via relationification, and RDFs, using novel abstractions. Encoding catamorphisms as CHCs allows learning inductive properties of catamorphisms, as well as preserving unsatisfiabilty of the original CHCs despite the use of RDF abstractions, whereas encoding catamorphisms as RDFs allows unfolding the recursive definition, and relying on it in solutions. Abstractions ensure that the underlying theory remains decidable. We implement our approach in Z3 and show that it works well in practice.",

    "abstract": "In recent years we have witnessed a dramatic increase in the adoption and application of smart contracts in a variety of contexts such as decentralized finance, supply chain management, and identity management. However, a critical stumbling block to the further adoption of smart contracts is their security. A particularly widespread class of security vulnerabilities that afflicts Ethereum smart contracts is the gas limit denial of service(DoS) on a contract via unbounded operations. These vulnerabilities result in a failed transaction with an out-of-gas error and are often present in contracts containing loops whose bounds are affected by end-user input. Note that such vulnerabilities differ from gas limit DoS on the network via block stuffing. Therefore, we present Gas Gauge, a tool aimed at detecting Out-of-Gas DoS vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts. Gas Gauge consists of three major components: the Detection, Identification, and Correction Phases. The Detection Phase consists of an accurate static analysis approach that finds and summarizes all the loops in a smart contract. The Identification Phase uses a white-box fuzzing approach to generate a set of inputs that causes the contract to run out of gas. The Correction Phase uses static analysis and run-time verification to predict the maximum loop bounds consistent with allowable gas usage and suggest appropriate repairs to the user of the tool. Each part of the tool can be used separately for different purposes or all together to detect, identify and help repair the contracts vulnerable to Out-of-Gas DoS vulnerabilities. Gas Gauge was tested on 1,000 real-world solidity smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum Mainnet. The results were compared to seven state-of-the-art static and symbolic tools, and it was empirically demonstrated that Gas Gauge is far more effective than competing state-of-the-art tools.",

    "abstract": "Fake news is undoubtedly a significant threat to democratic countries nowadays because existing technologies can quickly and massively produce fake videos, articles, or social media messages based on the rapid development of artificial intelligence and deep learning. Therefore, human assistance is critical if current fake news prevention systems desire to improve accuracy. Given this situation, prior research has proposed to add a quorum, a group of appraisers trusted by users to verify the authenticity of digital content, to the fake news prevention systems. This paper proposes an entropy-based incentive mechanism to diminish the negative effect of malicious behaviors on a quorum-based fake news prevention system. In order to maintain the Safety and Liveness of our system, we employed entropy to measure the degree of voting disagreement to determine appropriate rewards and penalties. To the best of our knowledge, we believe this is the first proposed work to leverage entropy in a fake news prevention system. Moreover, we use Hyperledger Fabric, Schnorr signatures, and human appraisers to implement a practical prototype of a quorum-based fake news prevention system. Then we conduct necessary case analyses and experiments to realize how dishonest participants, crash failures, and scale impact our system. The outcomes of the case analyses and experiments show that our mechanisms are feasible and provide an analytical basis for developing fake news prevention systems. Furthermore, we have added six innovative contributions in this extension work compared to our previous workshop paper in DEVIANCE 2021",

This thematic issue documents a wide range of innovative practices in planning enabled by games and gaming technologies. It attempts to open discussions about the way we conceptualize and treat new media and technologies in planning. By providing a wide range of examples, from non-digital games to gamified systems, interactive simulations and digital games, the issue shows that the lack of adoption of these practices has less to do with their technical possibilities and more to do with the way we understand tools and their added value in the dominant narratives of planning. As we note at the end, planning should be at the forefront of these technologies, not embracing technologies for technologies sake but because it should, as a profession, be leading the way into these new environments.",

    "abstract": "The planning process has been, arguably, slow to adapt and adopt new technologies: It is perhaps only now that it is starting to move into a more digitally focused era. Yet, it is not the current thinking around the digital that is going to change planning; it is the emerging metaverse. It is a change on the near horizon that is there but is currently largely unseen in the urban planning profession. The metaverse is, at first sight, a mirror to the current world, a digital twin, but it is more than this: It is an inhabited mirror world where the physical dimensions and rules of time and space do not necessarily apply. Operating across scales, from the change of use of a building up to a local plan and onwards to the scale of future cities, these emerging metaverses will exist either directly within computational space or emerge into our physical space via augmented reality. With economic systems operating via blockchain technology and the ability to instigate aspects of planning law, interspaced with design fiction type scenarios, they represent a new tool kit for the urban planner, spatial, economic, and social. We explore these emerging spaces, taking a look at their origins and how the use of game engines have allowed participation and design to become part of the workflow of these 3D spaces. Via a series of examples, we look at the current state of the art, explore the short term future, and speculate on digital planning using these incoming metaverses 10 years from now.",

    "abstract": "The rise of Ethereum has lead to a flourishing decentralized marketplace that has, unfortunately, fallen victim to frontrunning and Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) activities, where savvy participants game transaction orderings within a block for profit. One popular solution to address such behavior is Flashbots, a private pool with infrastructure and design goals aimed at eliminating the negative externalities associated with MEV. While Flashbots has established laudable goals to address MEV behavior, no evidence has been provided to show that these goals are achieved in practice. In this paper, we measure the popularity of Flashbots and evaluate if it is meeting its chartered goals. We find that (1) Flashbots miners account for over 99.9 % of the hashing power in the Ethereum network, (2) powerful miners are making more than 2× what they were making prior to using Flashbots, while non-miners’ slice of the pie has shrunk commensurately, (3) mining is just as centralized as it was prior to Flashbots with more than 90 % of Flashbots blocks coming from just two miners, and (4) while more than 80 % of MEV extraction in Ethereum is happening through Flashbots, 13.2 % is coming from other private pools.",

However, UST is not the only stablecoin to have been depegged in the past. Designing resilient and long-term stable coins, therefore, appears to present a hard challenge. To further scrutinize existing stablecoin designs and ultimately lead to more robust systems, we need to understand where volatility emerges. Our work provides a game-theoretical model aiming to help identify why stablecoins suffer from a depeg. This game-theoretical model reveals that stablecoins have different price equilibria depending on the coin's architecture and mechanism to minimize volatility. Moreover, our theory is supported by extensive empirical data, spanning 1 year. To that end, we collect daily prices for 22 stablecoins and on-chain data from five blockchains including the Ethereum and the Terra blockchain.",

    "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies were supposed to replace traditional payment methods when they were invented over 13 years ago, but adoption by the general consumer is still lacking, at least in the United States. Instead, crypto is often used as a speculative investment, by illicit actors, or for use cases unrelated to everyday purchases. A literature review on general adoption barriers and interviews with experts has only unearthed factors like usability, performance, and political drivers, among other barriers. Brand as an adoption barrier is mostly missing from literature, at least for cryptocurrencies. This led to the formation of a hypothesis related to crypto’s lack of adoption as a payment method. A framework is being designed based on the technology adoption model to find out if “brand” has an impact on cryptocurrency adoption, which was paradoxically designed to be brandless and not needing any institutional trust. The intent is to focus on what “Bitcoin 2.0” might look like, and to also delve further and gauge perceptions about various types of brands getting involved in the next generation of cryptocurrencies, including traditional banks, governments, technology companies, and also some of the decentralized and hybrid consortia currently vying to get consumers to use stablecoins, nation-issued cryptocurrencies, and other forms of digital instruments. While other studies had focused on trust, early adopter usability, or performance of blockchain networks, this work intends to focus on the general consumer’s perceptions about digital money, and the types of brands and evolution of this instrument liable to increase uptake.",

    "abstract": "The web and social media platforms have drastically changed how investors produce and consume financial advice. Historically, individual investors were often relying on newsletters and related prospectus backed by the reputation and track record of their issuers. Nowadays, financial advice is frequently offered online, by anonymous or pseudonymous parties with little at stake. As such, a natural question is to investigate whether these modern financial “influencers” operate in good faith, or whether they might be misleading their followers intentionally. To start answering this question, we obtained data from a very large cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, from which we derived individual trading positions. Some of the investors on that platform elect to link to their Twitter profiles. We were thus able to compare the positions publicly espoused on Twitter with those actually taken in the market. We discovered that 1) staunchly “bullish” investors on Twitter often took much more moderate, if not outright opposite, positions in their own trades when the market was down, 2) their followers tended to align their positions with bullish Twitter outlooks, and 3) moderate voices on Twitter (and their own followers) were on the other hand far more consistent with their actual investment strategies. In other words, while social media advice may attempt to foster a sense of camaraderie among people of like-minded beliefs, the reality is that this is merely an illusion, which may result in financial losses for people blindly following advice.",

    "abstract": "Most permissionless blockchain networks run on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, which offer flexibility and decentralization at the expense of performance (e.g., network latency). Historically, this tradeoff has not been a bottleneck for most blockchains. However, an emerging host of blockchain-based applications (e.g., decentralized finance) are increasingly sensitive to latency; users who can reduce their network latency relative to other users can accrue (sometimes significant) financial gains. In this work, we initiate the study of strategic latency reduction in blockchain P2P networks. We first define two classes of latency that are of interest in blockchain applications. We then show empirically that a strategic agent who controls only their local peering decisions can manipulate both types of latency, achieving 60% of the global latency gains provided by the centralized, paid service bloXroute, or, in targeted scenarios, comparable gains. Finally, we show that our results are not due to the poor design of existing P2P networks. Under a simple network model, we theoretically prove that an adversary can always manipulate the P2P network's latency to their advantage, provided the network experiences sufficient peer churn and transaction activity.",

    "abstract": "Crash fault tolerant (CFT) consensus algorithms are commonly used in scenarios where system components are trusted, such as enterprise settings. CFT algorithms offer high throughput and low latency, making them an attractive option for centralized operations that require fault tolerance. However, CFT consensus is vulnerable to Byzantine faults, which can be introduced by a single corrupt component. Such faults can break consensus in the system. Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms withstand Byzantine faults, but they are not as competitive with CFT algorithms in terms of performance. In this work, we explore a middle ground between BFT and CFT consensus by exploring the role of accountability in CFT protocols. That is, if a CFT protocol node breaks protocol and affects consensus safety, we aim to identify which node was the culprit. Based on Raft, one of the most popular CFT algorithms, we present Raft-Forensics, which provides accountability over Byzantine faults. We theoretically prove that if two honest components fail to reach consensus, the Raft-Forensics auditing algorithm finds the adversarial component that caused the inconsistency. In an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that Raft-Forensics performs similarly to Raft and significantly better than state-of-the-art BFT algorithms. With 256 byte messages, Raft-Forensics achieves peak throughput 87.8% of vanilla Raft at 46% higher latency, while state-of-the-art BFT protocol Dumbo-NG only achieves 18.9% peak throughput at nearly 6× higher latency.",

    "abstract": "In distributed systems, a group of learners achieve consensus when, by observing the output of some acceptors, they all arrive at the same value. Consensus is crucial for ordering transactions in failure-tolerant systems. Traditional consensus algorithms are homogeneous in three ways: (1) all learners are treated equally, (2) all acceptors are treated equally, and (3) all failures are treated equally.These assumptions, however, are unsuitable for cross-domain applications, including blockchains, where not all acceptors are equally trustworthy, and not all learners have the same assumptions and priorities. We present the first algorithm to be heterogeneous in all three respects. Learners set their own mixed failure tolerances over differently trusted sets of acceptors. We express these assumptions in a novel Learner Graph, and demonstrate sufficient conditions for consensus. We present Heterogeneous Paxos, an extension of Byzantine Paxos. Heterogeneous Paxos achieves consensus for any viable Learner Graph in best-case three message sends, which is optimal. We present a proof-of-concept implementation and demonstrate how tailoring for heterogeneous scenarios can save resources and reduce latency.",

    "abstract": "Yield farming represents an immensely popular asset management activity in decentralized finance (DeFi). It involves supplying, borrowing, or staking crypto assets to earn an income in forms of transaction fees, interest, or participation rewards at different DeFi marketplaces. In this systematic survey, we present yield farming protocols as an aggregation-layer constituent of the wider DeFi ecosystem that interact with primitive-layer protocols such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and loanable funds (PLFs) protocol for loanable funds (PLF). We examine the yield farming mechanism by first studying the operations encoded in the yield farming smart contracts, and then performing stylized, parameterized simulations on various yield farming strategies. We conduct a thorough literature review on related work, and establish a framework for yield farming protocols that takes into account pool structure, accepted token types, and implemented strategies. Using our framework, we characterize major yield aggregators in the market including Yearn Finance, Beefy, and Badger DAO. Moreover, we discuss anecdotal attacks against yield aggregators and generalize a number of risks associated with yield farming.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts have been subjected to several attacks that have exploited various vulnerabilities of languages like Solidity, which has resulted in huge financial losses. The functioning and deployment of smart contracts are somewhat different from classical programming environments. Once a smart contract is up and running, changing it, is very complicated and nearly infeasible as the contract is expected to be immutable when created. If we find a defect in a deployed smart contract, a new version of the contract has to be created and deployed with concurrence from the stakeholders. Further, when a new version of an existing contract is deployed, data stored in the previous contract does not get transferred automatically to the newly refined contract. We have to manually initialize the new contract with the past data which makes it very cumbersome and not very trustworthy. As neither updating a contract nor rolling back an update is possible, it greatly increases the complexity of implementation and places a huge responsibility while being deployed initially on the blockchain.\n \n The main rationale for smart contracts has been to enforce contracts safely among the stakeholders. In this paper, we shall discuss a framework for runtime monitoring to prevent the exploitation of a major class of vulnerabilities using the programmers’ annotations given in the smart contracts coded in Solidity. We have chosen several phrases for annotation mimicking declarations of concurrent programming languages so that the underlying run-time monitors can be automatically generated. The annotations simply reflect the intended constraints on the execution of programs relative to the object state relative to observables like method calls, exceptions, etc. Such a framework further adds to the advantage of debugging at the source level as the original structure is preserved and also enhances the trust of the user as the run-time monitoring assertion logs provide a rough proof-outline of the contract.",

While each of the existing access control models has its own benefits, it is difficult to satisfy all the requirements of a contemporary system with a single model. In this paper, we propose a unified model by combining three existing well-known models – Role-based Access Control (RBAC), Mandatory Access Control (MAC), and Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) – in a novel way. The proposed model, named Samyukta, combines these three models in a modular way and uses them in a specific order so that the modules complement each other and we gain benefits of all three models. The widely used RBAC, with its roles, provides scalability, auditability, and easy management. With its labels, MAC provides Information Flow Control (IFC), and ABAC, with its attributes, provides flexible, context-aware, fine-grained access control. Along with these benefits, Samyukta also has advantages with respect to expressiveness, performance, and verifiability. We provide a relative comparison of our model with an existing model and also present a prototype implementation of Samyukta and demonstrate its efficiency.",

    "abstract": "A digital certificate is by far the most widely used artifact to establish secure electronic communication over the Internet. It certifies to its user that the public key encapsulated in it is associated with the subject of the certificate. A Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is responsible to create, store, distribute, and revoke digital certificates. To establish a secure communication channel two unfamiliar entities rely on a common certificate issuer (a part of PKI) that vouches for both entities' certificates - thus authenticating each other via public keys listed in each other's certificates. Therefore, PKIs act as a trusted third party for two previously unfamiliar entities. Certificates are static data structures, their revocation status must be checked before usage; this step inadvertently involves a PKI for every secure channel establishment - leading to privacy violations of relying parties. As PKIs act as trust anchors for their subjects, any inadvertent event or malfeasance in PKI setup breaches the trust relationship leading to identity theft. Alternative PKI trust models, like PGP and SPKI, have been proposed but with limited deployment. With several retrofitting amendments to the prevalent X.509 standard, the standard has been serving its core objective of entity authentication but with modern requirements of contextual authentication, it is falling short to accommodate the evolving requirements. With the advent of blockchain as a trust management protocol, the time has come to rethink flexible alternatives to PKI core functionality; keeping in mind the modern-day requirements of contextual authentication-cum-authorization, weighted trust anchors, privacy-preservation, usability, and cost-efficient key management. In this paper, we assess this technology's complementary role in modern-day evolving security requirements. We discuss the feasibility of re-engineering PKIs with the help of blockchains, and identity networks.",

To address climate change, transitioning from conventional to sustainable infrastructure further imposes financing challenges. This study employs the Model approach to justify and predict how blockchain technologies can leverage infrastructure data to close the finance gap by introducing new financing mechanisms. A semisystematic literature review was carried out for infrastructure finance, sustainable infrastructure and smart cities finance mechanisms, as well as blockchains and oracles. Conventional infrastructure finance via debt and equity lacks benchmarks that reflect the risk-return characteristics of the asset class. Performance-based financing addresses this issue by integrating performance data in valuations. However, a lack of trust in data veracity remains. Blockchains provide trust and transparency in data and transactions. They utilize oracles to access off-chain information for on-chain decision-making. With smart contracts and decentralized oracle networks, a general approach is presented where data from internet-of-things inform on-chain transactions, delivering performance benchmarks that accurately reflect the risk-return characteristics in an infrastructure investment. Capital can then be more readily deployed, thus closing the finance gap. An end-to-end example of financing sustainable stormwater infrastructure, Open Storm, is also presented.",

We characterize the risk and return characteristics of yield farming and show that yield farms dynamically compete for liquidity by offering high yields that are advertised as salient headline rates. Levering the full history of transactions available through blockchain data, we show that investors chase farms with high yields and that those farms with the highest headline rates record the most negative risk-adjusted returns. That underperformance is amplified by small investment stakes and investor mistakes. Overall, our evidence is consistent with salience theory that may underpin reaching for yield behavior. We exploit heterogeneity in shocks to the information set of yield farmers to show that improved information disclosure and reduction in product complexity reduces yield chasing and improves investor performance. Since yield farming is easily accessible to retail investors, our analysis has important implications for the regulation of decentralized finance.",

Words related to animals (eg Doge), cartoons (eg Spongebob), and celebrities (eg Elon Musk) have been featured in token names. Exploiting the rich heterogeneity of such keywords, we find that investors’ interests shift between distinct meme styles, which we define as tokens sharing the same meme keywords. Token issuers cater to investor demand by issuing more tokens with popular meme keywords and profit from such issuances, primarily through fraud (exit scams). Consistent with salience theory’s prediction for competitive markets, issuers compete for investor attention by issuing tokens that feature more meme keywords and lower prices.",

Algorand uses a Byzantine agreement protocol to add new blocks to the blockchain. The protocol can tolerate malicious users as long as a supermajority of the stake is controlled by non-malicious users. The protocol achieves about 100x more throughput compared to Bitcoin and can be easily scaled to millions of nodes. Despite its impressive features, Algorand lacks a reward-distribution scheme that can effectively incentivize nodes to participate in the protocol. In this work, we study the incentive issue in Algorand through the lens of game theory. We model the Algorand protocol as a Bayesian game and propose a novel reward scheme to address the incentive issue in Algorand. We derive necessary conditions to ensure that participation in the protocol is a Bayesian Nash equilibrium under our proposed reward scheme even in the presence of a malicious adversary. We also present quantitative analysis of our proposed reward scheme by applying it to two real-world deployment scenarios. We estimate the costs of running an Algorand node and simulate the protocol to measure the overheads in terms of computation, storage, and networking.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain is a distributed ledger that uses cryptography and consensus protocols to record a growing list of transactions in a tamper-resistant manner. Scalability is one of the main problems that limit its usage. This paper introduces a full sharding protocol, Geochain, for permissioned blockchains. We first clarify the limitations of state-of-the-art sharding protocols. Then, we propose a locality-based sharding protocol that achieves high scalability. We optimize inter-shard performance by clustering participants using their geographical properties, locality. In addition, the locality is also employed to decide the transaction placement which results in a low ratio of cross-shard transactions for applications, such as everyday banking, retail payments, and electric vehicle charging. We also propose a client-driven efficient mechanism to handle cross-shard transactions and present an analysis. This enables clients to manage their assets across different shards directly. A prototype is implemented on top of Hyperledger Fabric v2.3 and evaluated on Amazon EC2. The experiments show that our protocol doubles the peak throughput, even with a high ratio of cross-shard transactions, while minimizing the transaction latency.",

    "abstract": "Blockchains are disrupting traditional finance by reducing the number of intermediaries and providing transparency. Blockchains, however, come with their own set of prominent issues. One such challenge is frontrunning. Attackers try to influence the transaction order so that their transaction executes before their victims' transaction. While frontrunning is a well-studied topic on Ethereum, it is unknown whether other blockchains are also susceptible to such attacks. One proposed defence strategy against frontrunning attacks is to randomize the transaction execution order. XRP Ledger is the highest-value blockchain to use such a strategy. Furthermore, it runs a Decentralized Exchange, which provides ample frontrunning opportunities. Therefore, in the context of XRP Ledger, we examine whether randomized transaction order provides sufficient protection against frontrunning. Our results show that the mechanism embedded in the XRP Ledger protocol is insufficient to prevent these attacks. We showcase two strategies to perform frontrunning attacks. The first, “naive” strategy, uses randomly generated accounts, whereas the second uses carefully selected accounts to improve the attack's success. Based on our analysis of the XRP Ledgers' historical data, we estimate that attackers could generate up to approx. 1.4M USD profit over two months, provided they succeeded to frontrun every opportunity",

The development of Palmas e-Dinheiro is strongly connected to the historical movement of community banks in the country. We start by presenting the context that has characterized the 20 years since the creation of Banco Palmas in 1998, including a description of the solidarity tools developed during this period to launch the e-Dinheiro mobile payment platform and support the operations of community banks. We conclude by describing the expansion of the e-Dinheiro platform, including its adoption by more than 80 community banks around the country and the creation of Banco Mumbuca in 2013, which currently has more than fifty thousand users and represents the largest e-Dinheiro operation.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies appear to be at a worldwide threshold of acceptance and adoption. Since their inception, several innovative projects have been proposing solutions to the blockchain trilemma, improving blockchain features and its technical limitations. However, the adoption of blockchain as a technology requires a comprehensive understanding and characterization of its technical aspects. The latter introduces an uncertainty for an organization to decide which blockchain protocol best meets its needs and demands. In general, there is a lack of proper testing and software engineering practices for assessing the usage of different blockchain protocols and understanding their performance. Toward that direction, this paper presents an architecture for a blockchain benchmarking framework that aims at the deployment and evaluation of different blockchain protocols. Moreover, we introduce a set of modules for testing and evaluating their behavior under different test-cases and scenarios. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed architecture we demonstrate an instantiation with the deployment of a private XRPL Network. The experiments conducted in this work were focused on how XRPL behaves under heavy load.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain is a disruptive technology that focuses on the safe exchange of data between several distributed applications. Despite its widespread adoption, there are areas that require further research towards the understanding of their performance characteristics. In addition, consensus algorithms, a vital part of blockchain, require a more comprehensive understanding of their technical principles and characteristics. Along with the design of different types of consensus algorithms, several challenges, such as system scalability and power consumption, have been raised. Therefore, more comprehensive research is needed to investigate the degree to which consensus algorithms are built and how they perform. To this end, this study extends the body of knowledge and contributes towards the assessment of blockchain protocol performance. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of selected studies on blockchain performance, identifying similarities and differences while attempting to identify existing work on simulators and benchmarking frameworks that aim to explore the performance of blockchain-enabled consensus algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies are poised to revolutionize the modern economy by democratizing commerce. These currencies operate on top of blockchain-based distributed ledgers. Existing permissionless blockchain-based protocols offer unparalleled benefits like decentralization, anonymity, and transparency. However, these protocols suffer in performance which hinders their widespread adoption. In particular, high time-to-finality and low transaction rates keep them from replacing centralized payment systems such as the Visa network. Permissioned blockchain protocols offer attractive performance guarantees, but they are not considered suitable for deploying decentralized cryptocurrencies due to their centralized nature. Researchers have developed several multi-layered blockchain protocols that combine both permissioned and permissionless blockchain protocols to achieve high performance along with decentralization. The key idea with existing layered blockchain protocols in literature is to divide blockchain operations into two layers and use different types of consensus to manage each layer. However, many such works come with the assumptions of honest majority which may not accurately reflect the real world where the participants may be self-interested or rational. These assumptions may render the protocols susceptible to security threats in the real world, as highlighted by the literature focused on exploring game-theoretic attacks on these protocols. We generalize the “layered” approach taken by existing protocols in the literature and present a framework to analyze the system in the BAR Model and provide a generalized game-theoretic analysis of such protocols. Using our analysis, we identify the critical system parameters required for a distributed ledger’s secure operation in a more realistic setting.",

    "abstract": "Vaccines are essential in protecting individuals and communities from the risk of harmful and fatal diseases. The world is migrating towards the digitization of vaccination documentation. Still, the current digital vaccination is a centralized model, lacking a universal acceptance. A Universally Acceptable and Ideal Vaccination System (UAIVS) should possess (a) a standard vaccination certificate verification algorithm, (b) privacy to personal information, (c) scalability, (d) support for all vaccinations, (e) accountability for vaccination information access, and (f) a scope for scientific research and development. Blockchain technology intruduces decentralization, immutability, accountability, persistence, and liveliness. These properties make blockchain an ideal candidate to solve the existing problems in digital vaccination. In this paper, we propose a novel block-chain-based system, namely BlockVac, to implement a UAIVS. Furthermore, our work provides a way to track an individual's and family's vaccination history, which is essential for scientific research and development. BlockVac is highly modular, sealable, and cost-efficient, providing enough room for future feature additions. The current works lack cost and scalability analysis. We show the scalability of our system through a thorough analysis. Our implementation shows that adding one vaccination record costs 7.16828×10−6 ETH (∼0.026USD) for registration, 2.5089×10−5 ETH (∼0.078USD) for vaccination, and the system can easily handle up to 20K vaccinations per hour.",

In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based secure data exchange and storage framework for the ITS (in short, we call it as BDESF-ITS). We conduct the security analysis of the BDESF-ITS to prove its robustness against various possible attacks. The practical implementation of the BDESF-ITS is also carried out to observe its behaviour with the real world settings.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology has a significant application in smart farming due to its immutability, decentralization and transparency properties. Data exchanged in an Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart agriculture can be used to remotely monitor the fields and regulate the crop needs for optimal productivity. However, such data is sensitive to several attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attack, replay attack, ephemeral secret leakage attack, impersonation attack and denial of service (DoS) attack. The existing solutions to counter these attacks are either costly or lack significant security features. To mitigate these issues, we design a novel lightweight blockchain based authentication scheme based on a fully decentralized and distributed architecture. The designed scheme is subjected to a rigorous security analysis and also a formal security verification using the widely-used Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool, and it is shown that the scheme is robust and secure against various passive and active attacks. A detailed comparative analysis shows that the proposed scheme has the low communication cost and significantly lower computation cost while satisfying all the security and functionality features as compared to those for other existing relevant schemes.",

To mitigate these issues, a blockchain driven authentication and key establishment protocol for secure communication in IoD has been designed (in short, it is called as BAKP-IoDA).

    "abstract": "After the success of the Bitcoin blockchain, came several cryptocurrencies and blockchain solutions in the last decade. Nonetheless, Blockchain-based systems still suffer from low transaction rates and high transaction processing latencies, which hinder blockchains’ scalability. An entire class of solutions, called Layer-1 scalability solutions, have attempted to incrementally improve such limitations by adding/modifying fundamental blockchain attributes. Recently, a completely different class of works, called Layer-2 protocols, have emerged to tackle the blockchain scalability issues using unconventional approaches. Layer-2 protocols improve transaction processing rates, periods, and fees by minimizing the use of underlying slow and costly blockchains. In fact, the main chain acts just as an instrument for trust establishment and dispute resolution among Layer-2 participants, where only a few transactions are dispatched to the main chain. Thus, Layer-2 blockchain protocols have the potential to transform the domain. However, rapid and discrete developments have resulted in diverse branches of Layer-2 protocols. In this work, we systematically create a broad taxonomy of such protocols and implementations. We discuss each Layer-2 protocol class in detail and also elucidate their respective approaches, salient features, requirements, etc. Moreover, we outline the issues related to these protocols along with a comparative discussion. Our thorough study will help further systematize the knowledge dispersed in the domain and help the readers to better understand the field of Layer-2 protocols.",

    "abstract": "Crowdsourcing is a practice of using collective intelligence of a group in order to achieve a common goal to solve complex problems in an innovative way. It involves obtaining information and opinions from a group of participants who submit their data (i.e., solutions) via the Internet using some applications. The application domains, where crowdsourcing can be used, include, but not limited to, healthcare, environment, public safety, disaster management, and transportation. Despite the unprecedented advantages of crowdsourcing, security and privacy are rising concerns that need to be addressed. Therefore, it is crucially important to provide effective solutions that address the security and privacy issues in crowdsourcing systems. To this end, the salient features of blockchain technology such as immutability, decentralization, transparency and resiliency can play a pivotal role to address the afore-mentioned security challenges. To fill these gaps, in this paper, we propose a new blockchain-based user authentication and key agreement scheme for crowdsourcing (BUAKA-CS) through lightweight cryptographic techniques. The security of the BUAKA-CS is proved through the formal method and also through other mathematical methods that depict the resilience of BUAKA-CS against various types of possible attacks. Moreover, the robustness of BUAKA-CS against possible attacks is proved through widely-recognized automated software validation tools. We also compare BUAKA-CS with other existing schemes and prove its out performance in terms of security, functionality, computation and communication costs. Finally, we conduct the extensive blockchain-based simulations to measure the impact of BUAKA-CS on the performance of the system.",

The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) allows us to deploy several wearable Internet of Things-enabled smart devices in a patient's body. The deployed smart devices should then securely communicate to nearby mobile devices installed in a smart home, which then securely communicate with the associated fog server for information processing. The processed information in terms of transactions are formed as blocks and put into a private blockchain consisting of cloud servers. Since the patient's vital signs are very confidential and private, we apply the private blockchain. This article makes utilization of fog computing and blockchain technology simultaneously to come up with more secure system in an IoMT-enabled COVID-19 situation for patients’ home monitoring purpose. We first discuss various phases related to development of a new fog-based private blockchain-enabled home monitoring framework. Next, we discuss how artificial intelligence-enabled big data analytics helps in analyzing and tracking the patients’ information related to COVID-19 cases. Finally, a blockchain implementation has been performed to exhibit practical demonstration of the proposed blockchain system.",

    "abstract": "The recent surge in development of smart homes and smart cities can be observed in many developed countries. While the idea to control devices that are in home (embedded with the Internet of Things (IoT) smart devices) by the user who is outside the home might sound fancy, but it comes with a lot of potential threats. There can be many attackers who will be trying to take advantage of this. So, there is a need for designing a secure scheme which will be able to distinguish among genuine/authorized users of the system and attackers. And knowing about the details of when and what IoT devices are used by the user, the attacker can trace the daily activities of user and can plan an attack accordingly. Thus, the designed security scheme should guarantee confidentiality, anonymity and un-traceability. Most of the schemes proposed in the literature are either non-blockchain based which involves inherent problems of storing data in a single-server or assuming weaker attack models. In this work, we propose a novel scheme based on blockchain technology, assuming a stronger Canetti and Krawczyk (CK)-threat model. Through the formal and informal security, and comparative analysis, we show that the proposed scheme provides a superior security and more functionality features, with less communication cost and comparable computational cost as compared to other competent schemes. Moreover, the blockchain based simulation study on the proposed scheme has been conducted to show its feasibility in real-life application.",

Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) can support vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications to realize connected vehicle. In VANETs, secure communication must be ensured, as otherwise it can lead to traffic accidents and human injuries. Recently, many studies on V2I authentication have been conducted to guarantee the security of V2I communications. However, recent V2I authentication protocols do not consider the handover situation, and it causes unnecessary computations. As vehicles have limited computing resources, unnecessary computation can lead to overload to the vehicles. In recent years, blockchain-based VANET is an active field of research because it can provide decentralization, data integrity and transparency. Using the strength of the blockchain technology, we design a blockchain-based handover authentication protocol for VANETs. In the proposed protocol, vehicles only perform lightweight computations in handover situations for efficiency of the network. We also conduct the formal analysis such as Burrows–Abadi–Needham (BAN) logic, Real-Or-Random (ROR) oracle model, and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) simulation to the proposed protocol. We simulate the proposed protocol using network simulator 3 (NS-3) to verify that the proposed protocol is practical. Finally, we compare the computational cost and security features of the proposed protocol with existing protocols to show that the proposed protocol is more secure and efficient.",

    "abstract": "With rapid advancements in the technology, almost all the devices around are becoming smart and contribute to the Internet of Things (IoT) network. When a new IoT device is added to the network, it is important to verify the authenticity of the device before allowing it to communicate with the network. Hence, access control is a crucial security mechanism that allows only the authenticated node to become the part of the network. An access control mechanism also supports confidentiality, by establishing a session key that accomplishes secure communications in open public channels. Recently, blockchain has been implemented in access control protocols to provide a better security mechanism. The foundation of this survey article is laid on IoT, where a detailed description on IoT, its architecture and applications is provided. Further, various security challenges and issues, security attacks possible in IoT and their countermeasures are also provided. We emphasize on the blockchain technology and its evolution in IoT. A detailed description on existing consensus mechanisms and how blockchain can be used to overpower IoT vulnerabilities is highlighted. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive description on access control protocols. The protocols are classified into certificate-based, certificate-less and blockchain-based access control mechanisms for better understanding. We then elaborate on each use case like smart home, smart grid, health care and smart agriculture while describing access control mechanisms. The detailed description not only explains the implementation of the access mechanism, but also gives a wider vision on IoT applications. Next, a rigorous comparative analysis is performed to showcase the efficiency of all protocols in terms of computation and communication costs. Finally, we discuss open research issues and challenges in a blockchain-envisioned IoT network.",

    "abstract": "The deployed vehicles in an Internet of Vehicles (IoV) can take intelligent decisions by means of exchanging the real-time traffic-related information between the vehicles and IoV infrastructures. This further reduces the probability of the traffic jams and accidents. However, the insecure (public) communication among the various entities in IoV makes various security threats and attacks that can be launched by passive/active adversaries present in the network. In view of this context, there is a need of an efficient cryptographic primitive which can produce single compact signature. A multi-signature scheme (MSS) empowers a collection of signers to conjointly sign a given message using a single compact signature that can be verified by any verifier. Herein, we put forward a new identity-based multivariate MSS, namely MV-MSS , which is built on top of the intractability of multivariate-quadratic (MQ) problem. The fact is that multivariate public key cryptosystem provides fast, post-quantum safe and efficient primitives, which makes it the front runner candidate among the post-quantum cryptographic candidates. MV-MSS is proven to be secure in the existential unforgeability under chosen-message and chosen identity attack model if solving the MQ problem is NP-hard. We then incorporate the designed MV-MSS in IoV application where the leader (cluster head) selected from a group of vehicles in a dynamic cluster forms the multi-signatures on the messages securely received from its member vehicles. Later, the messages along with their multi-signatures are forwarded to the nearby road-side unit (RSU) of the cluster head, which are then forwarded to a cloud server in the blockchain center maintained by a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud servers network. In this way, the messages and their signatures considered as transactions are put in blocks and added into a public blockchain with the help of consensus algorithm. A comparative study among the proposed MV-MSS and other existing schemes shows that MV-MSS is efficient and secure as compared to other schemes. Finally, a blockchain implementation through simulation study has been performed to show its practical use in IoV application.",

Most of the organizations, such as financial institutes and healthcare sectors (i.e., smart healthcare) are targeted by ransomware attacks. Ransomware assaults are among the most frightening types of cyber-attacks, and they are not confined to a specific sector or the countries. Blockchain is a tamper-proof technology, which is more secure, robust and decentralized in nature. Features of blockchain can add more security for detection and mitigation of ransomware more effectively. In this paper, we propose a new blockchain-enabled security framework to detect and defend the ransomware attacks for smart healthcare (in short, BSFR-SH). The conducted security analysis proves the security of the proposed BSFR-SH against the ransomware attacks. The performance of BSFR-SH is significantly better than the other similar existing mechanisms as it achieves better accuracy and F1-score than other compared mechanisms. Furthermore, the practical demonstration of BSFR-SH is provided to estimate the impact on important performance parameters.",

Data poising attacks are very serious concerns because they may play a significant factor for businesses and organizations for both financial terms and damaging their reputations, when the Big data analytics on the analyzed data is itself corrupted. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we suggest a blockchain-based Artificial Intelligence(AI)/Machine Learning(ML)-enabled Big data analytics mechanism for CIoT environment. The comprehensive experimental results have been provided under two circumstances: (1) performance of the ML model under data poisoning attacks and (2) performance of the ML model without data poisoning attacks. In the first case, we show how the data poison attacks can effect the ML model when the data is on some cloud storage (i.e. not in the blockchains), whereas in the second case we show the effect when the data is in the blockchains (i.e., without data poisoning attacks). The experimental results demonstrate that we have significant gains in performance in terms of accuracy, recall, precision and F1 score when there are no data poisoning attacks on the data. Moreover, a detailed blockchain simulation has carried out to demonstrate the practical aspects of the proposed security framework.",

To build these applications, the data is collected from devices into data centers for training ML models. Usually, the training of models is performed on central server, but this approach requires the transfer of data from devices to central server. This centralized training approach is not efficient because the users are much less likely to share data to the centralized data centers due to privacy issues and bandwidth limitations. To mitigate these issues, we propose an efficient hybrid secure federated learning approach with the blockchain to securely train the model locally on devices and then to store the model and its parameters into the blockchain for traceability and immutability.

Blockchain technology is a better alternative for storing and sharing farm data as it is reliable, transparent, immutable, and decentralized. Remote monitoring of an agricultural field requires security systems to ensure that any sensitive information is exchanged only among authenticated entities in the network. To this end, we design an efficient blockchain-enabled authenticated key agreement scheme for mobile vehicles-assisted precision agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) networks called AgroMobiBlock . The limited existing work on authentication in agricultural networks shows passive usage of blockchains with very high costs. AgroMobiBlock proposes a novel idea using the elliptic curve operations on an active hybrid blockchain over mobile farming vehicles with low computation and communication costs. Formal and informal security analysis along with the formal security verification using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) software tool have shown the robustness of AgroMobiBlock against man-in-the-middle, impersonation, replay, physical capture, and ephemeral secret leakage attacks among other potential attacks. The blockchain-based simulation on large-scale nodes shows the computational time for an increase in the network and block sizes. Moreover, the real-time testbed experiments have been performed to show the practical usefulness of the proposed scheme.",

For this purpose, after a mutual authentication performed between a user and the accessed server, a session key needs to be established among them for secure communication. In this article, we design an efficient lattice-based authenticated key exchange protocol using ring-based version of learning with errors assumption for the IoT-enabled smart devices. The proposed protocol is basically a key exchange that uses the reconciliation mechanism. The detailed security analysis under the standard model has been performed along with the informal security analysis to show that the proposed protocol is robust against different attacks. We then simulate the proposed protocol under the NS-3 simulator to measure the network performance parameters like network throughput and latency. A comparative analysis shows that the proposed protocol has superior security, less computational cost, and comparable communication cost when compered these parameters with the other competing schemes.",

    "abstract": "We are thrilled to announce the release of the “Decentralized Autonomous Organization Toolkit”. It is the second in a series of outputs from our joint World Economic Forum and Wharton BDAP DAO Project series collaboration that began with DAOs: Beyond the Hype.\n \n The DAO Toolkit is an insight report designed to provide tools for policy-makers, entrepreneurs and others seeking to engage with the DAO ecosystem. The product of an international collaboration of experts, the Toolkit offers evaluation frameworks, tools, and recommendations regarding DAO operations, governance, law and policy. \n \n Collaboratively-governed and code-driven, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are engaged in nothing less than an experiment to reimagine how we connect, collaborate, and create. Although DAOs today manage billions of dollars’ worth of assets, engage millions of contributors, and operate across industries as diverse as finance and philanthropy, basic questions regarding operations, governance, law and policy are only just beginning to be addressed by policy-makers, regulators and entrepreneurs\n \n We are grateful to the global team of experts and leaders working with us on this initiative since January 2022.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized Finance (‘DeFi’) has gained tremendous momentum over the past three years by using novel approaches to disintermediating financial institutions in the provision of financial services. However, empirical research in this field is still rare, and a more comprehensive understanding of the domain is a missing component in academic research. This paper develops a taxonomy based on a comprehensive literature analysis to structure this emerging field systematically. The taxonomy includes three perspectives (strategy, organization, technology) and seven dimensions (blockchain, value proposition, token type, business process, price mechanism, protocol type, integration type) as well as thirty-six characteristics. The application of the taxonomy to 278 DeFi start-ups reveals that most of the DeFi start-ups focus on Ethereum (36.3%) and have a focus on analytics and automation (52%), while, surprisingly only a few incorporate decentralized governance approaches (3.3%), provide decentralized exchanges (14%) or integrate off-chain data.",

While both concepts have been researched in recent years, their intersection, often conceived as “green FinTech,” remains under-determined. Therefore, this paper contributes to this important discussion about green FinTech by, first, synthesizing the relevant literature systematically. Second, it shows the results of an empirical, in-depth analysis of the Swiss FinTech landscape both in terms of green FinTech startups as well as the services offered by the incumbents. The research results show that literature in this new domain has only emerged recently, is mostly characterized by a specific focus on isolated aspects of green FinTech and does not provide a comprehensive perspective on the topic yet. In addition, the results from the literature and the market analysis indicate that green FinTech has an impact along the whole value chain of financial services covering customer-to-customer (c2c), business-to-customer (b2c), and business-to-business (b2b) services. Today the field is predominantly captured by startup companies in contrast to the incumbents whose solutions are still rare.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity is proposed as a sustainable alternative for the economic development of high-biodiversity regions. Especially in the field of biodiversity genomics, the development of low-cost DNA sequencing opens an opportunity for new actors beyond academia to engage in genomic sequencing. However, it is challenging to adequately compensate non-academic actors such as local populations for their contribution to the innovation process, preventing better bioeconomy development. Although many repositories register genomic data to support biodiversity research, they do not facilitate the fair sharing of economic benefits. In this work, we propose the creation of the Amazon Biobank, a community-based genetic database. We employed blockchain to build a transparent and verifiable log of transactions involving genomic data, and we used smart contracts to implement an internal monetary system for all participants who collect, insert, process, store, and validate genomic data. We also used peer-to-peer solutions to allow users with commodity computers to collaborate with the storage and distribution of DNA files. By combining emerging technologies, Amazon Biobank provides adequate benefit-sharing among all participants that collaborate with data, knowledge, and computational resources. It also provides traceability and auditability, allowing easy association between biotechnological research and DNA data. In addition, the solution is highly scalable and less dependent on the trust deposited in any system player. Therefore, Amazon Biobank can become an important stepping stone to unlock the potential of bioeconomy in rich ecosystems such as the Amazon Rainforest.",

In this work, we present event2ledger, a blockchain-based solution that implements a distributed log with data sent by authorized and customized collectors to a permissioned consortium blockchain, responsible for ordering and storage in a distributed and auditable manner. A proof-of-concept is implemented with a Hyperledger Fabric consortium blockchain, composed and maintained by the scenario actors (i.e., Providers, Users, and Developers), which stores signed container life cycle events.",

In parallel, the adoption of resource virtualization is a reality to efficiently manage data centers. Consequently, the institutions have integrated blockchain networks into their own systems, hosting blockchain nodes atop virtual machines (VMs). In this sense, we present a resistance analysis of an Ethereum-based network hosted by VMs. The Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are used to identify the impact on the standard VM flavor. Specifically, we developed an environment for carrying out experiments using Ethereum configured with distinct consensus mechanisms: RAFT, Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance (iBFT), and Proof-of-Authority (PoA). Each scenario is in-depth analyzed facing the DoS attack. Our results show that a private blockchain can suffer DoS when configured only to satisfy the default configuration defined by the application.",

We hereby describe a SNARK for CSI-FiSh signatures, whose security stems from hard problems involving supersingular isogenies. Although the scheme looks analogous to a SNARK for conventional Schnorr signatures, it is non-trivial in that, as we also show, a similar SNARK for another isogeny-based signature scheme (SQISign) is not viable. As a bonus, we also discuss how to drastically reduce the memory needed to implement the CSIDH framework required by CSI-FiSh signatures.",

The aim is to test whether or not GARCH models provide risk managers more accurate volatility forecasts for digital currencies as high volatilile assets. A large empirical analysis is performed by comparing one-step-ahead volatility predictions from different specifications of GARCH models. GARCH specifications are up to four scedastic functions and six error distributions, resulting in a total of twenty four estimated models for each cryptocurrency studied in this work. Results showed that component GARCH model is the structure that achieved higher accuracy in modeling and forecasting the volatility process of the digital currencies returns. It also indicates that, in such market, the conditional variance dynamics is better described by a permanent and a transitory components, allowing for transitory shocks.",

However, current health services are inefficient, facing problems of inadequate treatment, human resources, infrastructure, and high costs. Digital health technologies play an increasingly important role in healthcare services such as remote care and vital signs monitoring. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)., which is a customized version of the Internet of Things (IoT), is increasingly important as it interconnects different medical devices, sensors, patients, and doctors, among others. This brings several benefits in improving health services. Nevertheless, in the IoMT environment, there are several challenges to overcome. Blockchain technology, a distributed ledger, with its Immutability, transparency, and anonymity features, is being used in IoMT to help overcome these challenges. In this paper, a systematic review was carried out to identify the research topics of blockchain application in IoMT., the challenges in IoMT., how blockchain helps to overcome them, and the maturity stage of those works. The review results allowed us to identify five research topics in which the main ones are authentication and intrusion detection. This review shows an overview of current research on this subject, giving the possibility of directing other research works, or optimizing the existing ones.",

The high return on cryptocurrency during the pandemic has served as an incentive for all ethnic groups to participate in the market. Cryptocurrency is perceived as a hedging instrument for wealth prospects across races during COVID-19. Considering the return on investment, to what extent is blockchain a good hedging instrument for minority investors? Using weekly trade price data from Yahoo Finance, market valuations from coinranking.com, and asset/equity variables from the Federal Reserve Bank, this paper examines investment strategies of different racial/ethnic groups in cryptocurrency during the pandemic in a panel data model from 2019 to 2021. Should investors use public coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum as part of their investment portfolio mix during the pandemic? We find that an increase in the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies during the pandemic may repress the investment strategy for marginalized groups.",

Digitalization, such as blockchain technology, shows the potential to reshape supply chain management. Using distributed ledger technology, the blockchain platform provides a digital system and database to record the transactions along the supply chain. This decentralized database of transactions brings transparency, reliability, traceability, and efficiency to the supply chain management. This paper focuses on such novel blockchain-based supply chain management and its sustainability performances in the areas of environmental protection, social equity, and governance efficiency. Using a systematic literature review and two case studies, we evaluate whether the three sustainability indicators can be improved indirectly along supply chains based on blockchain technology. Our study shows that blockchain technology has the potential to improve supply chain sustainability performance, and we expect blockchain technology to rise in popularity in supply chain management.",

We found characteristic differences between those fiat currencies and cryptoassets during the bubble period. For ETH, there was a significant increase in the loop flow during the cryptoasset price peak. This might be related to money laundering or arbitrage transaction.

In this article, we focus on analyzing transaction data for the 2017-2018 period that consist one of the significant XRP market price bursts. We construct weekly weighted directed networks of XRP transactions. These weekly networks are embedded on continuous vector space using a network embedding technique that encodes structural regularities present in the network structure in terms of node vectors. Using a suitable time window we calculate a correlation tensor. A double singular value decomposition of the correlation tensor provides key insights about the system. The significance of the correlation tensor is captured using a randomized correlation tensor. We present a detailed dependence of correlation tensor on model parameters.",

Civil liberty campaigners on the other hand argue that such mandatory instruments encroach upon our fundamental right to anonymity, freedom of movement, and are a backdoor to issuing “identity documents” to citizens by their governments. We present a privacy-preserving framework that uses two-factor authentication to create a unique identifier that can be used to locate a person’s vaccination record on a blockchain, but does not store any personal information about them. Our main contribution is the employment of a locality sensitive hashing algorithm over an iris extraction technique, that can be used to authenticate users and anonymously locate vaccination records on the blockchain, without leaking any personally identifiable information to the blockchain. Our proposed system allows for the safe reopening of society, while maintaining the privacy of citizens.",

Using rich data from the Ethereum blockchain, the mempool, and exchanges, we study the effect of EIP-1559, one of the earliest-deployed TFMs that depart from the traditional first-price auction paradigm. We conduct a rigorous and comprehensive empirical study to examine its causal effect on blockchain transaction fee dynamics, transaction waiting times, and consensus security. Our results show that EIP-1559 improves the user experience by mitigating intrablock differences in the gas price paid and reducing users' waiting times. However, EIP-1559 has only a small effect on gas fee levels and consensus security. In addition, we find that when Ether's price is more volatile, the waiting time is significantly higher. We also verify that a larger block size increases the presence of siblings. These findings suggest new directions for improving TFMs.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies appear to be at a worldwide threshold of acceptance and adoption. Since their inception, several innovative projects have been proposing solutions to the blockchain trilemma, improving blockchain features and its technical limitations. However, the adoption of blockchain as a technology requires a comprehensive understanding and characterization of its technical aspects. The latter introduces an uncertainty for an organization to decide which blockchain protocol best meets its needs and demands. In general, there is a lack of proper testing and software engineering practices for assessing the usage of different blockchain protocols and understanding their performance. Toward that direction, this paper presents an architecture for a blockchain benchmarking framework that aims at the deployment and evaluation of different blockchain protocols. Moreover, we introduce a set of modules for testing and evaluating their behavior under different test-cases and scenarios. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed architecture we demonstrate an instantiation with the deployment of a private XRPL Network. The experiments conducted in this work were focused on how XRPL behaves under heavy load.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain is a disruptive technology that focuses on the safe exchange of data between several distributed applications. Despite its widespread adoption, there are areas that require further research towards the understanding of their performance characteristics. In addition, consensus algorithms, a vital part of blockchain, require a more comprehensive understanding of their technical principles and characteristics. Along with the design of different types of consensus algorithms, several challenges, such as system scalability and power consumption, have been raised. Therefore, more comprehensive research is needed to investigate the degree to which consensus algorithms are built and how they perform. To this end, this study extends the body of knowledge and contributes towards the assessment of blockchain protocol performance. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of selected studies on blockchain performance, identifying similarities and differences while attempting to identify existing work on simulators and benchmarking frameworks that aim to explore the performance of blockchain-enabled consensus algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The arithmetic of computing multiple scalar multiplications in an elliptic curve group and then adding them together is known as multi-scalar multiplication (MSM). In the context of the pairing-based trusted setup for zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zkSNARK), MSM over fixed points is a significant time-consuming element. Therefore, for practical applications, fast algorithms for computing MSM are highly valued. This paper introduces a bucket set construction designed to be integrated with Pippenger’s bucket method, enhancing the efficiency of MSM over fixed points through precomputation. Specifically, if applied to the BLS12-381 curve and calculating n-scalar multiplications where n equals 2 to the power of e (with e ranging from 10 to 21), theoretical analysis suggests that this new construction offers a computational cost reduction of over 21% compared to the original Pippenger’s method. Moreover, it reduces computational costs by 2.6% to 9.6% compared to the most popular variant of Pippenger’s method. Experimental results confirm the practicality of using large precomputation tables to speed up MSM over fixed points and demonstrate the effectiveness of this new construction.",

    "abstract": "A Single Secret Leader Election (SSLE) enables a group of parties to randomly choose exactly one leader from the group with the restriction that the identity of the leader will be known to the chosen leader and nobody else. At a later time, the elected leader should be able to publicly reveal her identity and prove that she is the elected leader. The election process itself should work properly even if many registered users are passive and do not send any messages. SSLE is used to strengthen the security of proof-of-stake consensus protocols by ensuring that the identity of the block proposer remains unknown until the proposer publishes a block. Boneh, Eskandarian, Hanzlik, and Greco (AFT'20) defined the concept of an SSLE and gave several constructions. Their most efficient construction is based on the difficulty of the Decision Diffie-Hellman problem in a cyclic group. \n  \n  In this work we construct the first efficient SSLE protocols based on the standard Learning With Errors (LWE) problem on integer lattices, as well as the Ring-LWE problem. Both are believed to be post-quantum secure. Our constructions generalize the paradigm of Boneh et al. by introducing the concept of a re-randomizable commitment (RRC). We then construct several post-quantum RRC schemes from lattice assumptions and prove the security of the derived SSLE protocols. Constructing a lattice-based RRC scheme is non-trivial, and may be of independent interest.",

The original Nova paper (CRYPTO'22) presented Nova using a single elliptic curve group of order \n  . However, for improved efficiency, the implementation of Nova alters the scheme to use a 2-cycle of elliptic curves. This altered scheme is only described in the code and has not been proven secure. In this work, we point out a soundness vulnerability in the original implementation of the 2-cycle Nova system. To demonstrate this vulnerability, we construct a convincing Nova proof for the correct evaluation of \n  rounds of the Minroot VDF in only 1.46 seconds. We then present a modification of the 2-cycle Nova system and formally prove its security. The modified system also happens to be more efficient than the original implementation. In particular, the modification eliminates an R1CS instance-witness pair from the recursive proof. The implementation of Nova has now been updated to use our optimized and secure system. We also show that Nova's IVC proofs are malleable and discuss several mitigations.",

Plonk is quite flexible: it supports circuits with low-degree “custom” gates as well as circuits with lookup gates (a lookup gate ensures that its input is contained in a predefined table). For large circuits, the bottleneck in generating a Plonk proof is the need for computing a large FFT.\n  \n  We present HyperPlonk, an adaptation of Plonk to the boolean hypercube, using multilinear polynomial commitments. HyperPlonk retains the flexibility of Plonk but provides several additional benefits. First, it avoids the need for an FFT during proof generation. Second, and more importantly, it supports custom gates of much higher degree than Plonk without harming the running time of the prover. Both of these can dramatically speed up the prover’s running time. Since HyperPlonk relies on multilinear polynomial commitments, we revisit two elegant constructions: one from Orion and one from Virgo. We show how to reduce the Orion opening proof size to less than 10 KB (an almost factor 1000 improvement) and show how to make the Virgo FRI-based opening proof simpler and shorter (This is an extended abstract.

    "abstract": "An accountable threshold signature (ATS) is a threshold signature scheme where every signature identifies the quorum of signers who generated that signature. They are widely used in financial settings where signers need to be held accountable for threshold signatures they generate. In this paper we initiate the study of proactive refresh for accountable threshold signatures. Proactive refresh is a protocol that lets the group of signers refresh their shares of the secret key, without changing the public key or the threshold. We give several definitions for this notion achieving different levels of security. We observe that certain natural constructions for an ATS cannot be proactively refreshed because the secret key generated at setup is needed for accountability. We then construct three types of ATS schemes with proactive refresh. The first is a generic construction that is efficient when the number of signers is small. The second is a hybrid construction that performs well for a large number of signers and satisfies a strong security definition. The third is a collection of very practical constructions derived from ATS versions of the Schnorr and BLS signature schemes; however these practical constructions only satisfy our weaker notion of security.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic vector commitments that enable local updates of opening proofs have applications ranging from verifiable databases with membership changes to stateless clients on blockchains. In these applications, each user maintains a relevant subset of the committed messages and the corresponding opening proofs with the goal of ensuring a succinct global state. When the messages are updated, users are given some global update information and update their opening proofs to match the new vector commitment. We investigate the relation between the size of the update information and the runtime complexity needed to update an individual opening proof. Existing vector commitment schemes require that either the information size or the runtime scale linearly in the number k of updated state elements. We construct a vector commitment scheme that asymptotically achieves both length and runtime that is sublinear in k. We prove an information-theoretic lower bound on the relation between the update information size and runtime complexity that shows the asymptotic optimality of our scheme. While in practice, the construction is not yet competitive with Verkle commitments, our approach may point the way towards more performant vector commitments.",

A prerequisite to solving a problem is understanding the nature of the problem. Assembling a diverse set of public, proprietary, and hand-collected data, including dark web conversations in Russian, we conduct the first detailed anatomy of crypto-enabled cybercrimes and highlight relevant economic issues. Our analyses reveal that a few organized ransomware gangs dominate the space and have evolved into sophisticated corporate-like operations with physical offices, franchising, and affiliation programs. Leading ransomware gangs operate from Russian-speaking regions and mainly target U.S. and Western Europe enterprises. Their techniques have become more aggressive, entailing multiple extortion and reputation management layers and leading firms to underreport security breaches. Blanket restrictions on cryptocurrency usage may prove ineffective in tackling crypto-enabled cybercrime and hinder innovations. Instead, blockchain transparency and digital footprints enable effective forensics for tracking, monitoring, and shutting down dominant cybercriminal organizations.",

FinTech lending has grown rapidly, though in developed economies like the United States it still accounts for only a small share of total credit. An increase in convenience and speed appears to have been more central to FinTech lending's growth than improved screening or monitoring, though there is certainly potential for the latter, as is the case for increased financial inclusion.

    "abstract": "Researchers and practitioners have designed and implemented various automated test case generators to support effective software testing. Such generators exist for various languages (e.g., Java, C#, or Python) and various platforms (e.g., desktop, web, or mobile applications). The generators exhibit varying effectiveness and efficiency, depending on the testing goals they aim to satisfy (e.g., unit-testing of libraries versus system-testing of entire applications) and the underlying techniques they implement. In this context, practitioners need to be able to compare different generators to identify the most suited one for their requirements, while researchers seek to identify future research directions. This can be achieved by systematically executing large-scale evaluations of different generators. However, executing such empirical evaluations is not trivial and requires substantial effort to select appropriate benchmarks, setup the evaluation infrastructure, and collect and analyse the results. In this Software Note, we present our JUnit Generation Benchmarking Infrastructure (JUGE) supporting generators (search-based, random-based, symbolic execution, etc.) seeking to automate the production of unit tests for various purposes (validation, regression testing, fault localization, etc.). The primary goal is to reduce the overall benchmarking effort, ease the comparison of several generators, and enhance the knowledge transfer between academia and industry by standardizing the evaluation and comparison process. Since 2013, several editions of a unit testing tool competition, co-located with the Search-Based Software Testing Workshop, have taken place where JUGE was used and evolved. As a result, an increasing amount of tools (over 10) from academia and industry have been evaluated on JUGE, matured over the years, and allowed the identification of future research directions. Based on the experience gained from the competitions, we discuss the expected impact of JUGE in improving the knowledge transfer on tools and approaches for test generation between academia and industry. Indeed, the JUGE infrastructure demonstrated an implementation design that is flexible enough to enable the integration of additional unit test generation tools, which is practical for developers and allows researchers to experiment with new and advanced unit testing tools and approaches.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain systems are prone to concurrency bugs due to the nondeterminism in the delivery order of messages between the distributed nodes. These bugs are hard to detect since they can only be triggered by a specific order or timing of concurrent events in the execution. Systematic concurrency testing techniques, which explore all possible delivery orderings of messages to uncover concurrency bugs, are not scalable to large distributed systems such as blockchains. Random concurrency testing methods search for bugs in a randomly generated set of executions and offer a practical testing method.In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of random concurrency testing on blockchain systems using a case study on the XRP Ledger of the Ripple blockchain, which maintains one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the market today. We test the Ripple consensus algorithm of the XRP Ledger by exploring different delivery orderings of consensus protocol messages. Moreover, we design an evolutionary algorithm to guide the random test case generation toward certain system behaviors to discover concurrency bugs more efficiently. Our case study shows that random concurrency testing is effective at detecting concurrency bugs in blockchains, and the evolutionary approach for test generation improves test efficiency. Our experiments could successfully detect the bugs we seeded in the Ripple source code. Moreover, we discovered a previously unknown concurrency bug in the production implementation of Ripple.",

    "abstract": "Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithms promise agreement on a correct value, even if a subset of processes can deviate from the algorithm arbitrarily. While these algorithms provide strong guarantees in theory, in practice, protocol bugs and implementation mistakes may still cause them to go wrong. This paper introduces ByzzFuzz, a simple yet effective method for automatically finding errors in implementations of Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithms through randomized testing. ByzzFuzz detects fault-tolerance bugs by injecting randomly generated network and process faults into their executions. To navigate the space of possible process faults, ByzzFuzz introduces small-scope message mutations which mutate the contents of the protocol messages by applying small changes to the original message either in value (e.g., by incrementing the round number) or in time (e.g., by repeating a proposal value from a previous message). We find that small-scope mutations, combined with insights from the testing and fuzzing literature, are effective at uncovering protocol logic and implementation bugs in real-world fault-tolerant systems.\n  \n  We implemented ByzzFuzz and applied it to test the production implementations of two popular blockchain systems, Tendermint and Ripple, and an implementation of the seminal PBFT protocol. ByzzFuzz detected several bugs in the implementation of PBFT, a potential liveness violation in Tendermint, and materialized two theoretically described vulnerabilities in Ripple’s XRP Ledger Consensus Algorithm. Moreover, we discovered a previously unknown fault-tolerance bug in the production implementation of Ripple, which is confirmed by the developers and fixed.",

    "abstract": "In PCNs, nodes that forward payments between a source and a receiver are paid a small fee if the payment is successful. The fee is a compensation for temporarily committing funds to the payment. However, payments may fail due to insufficient funds or attacks, often after considerable delays of up to several days, leaving a node without compensation. Furthermore, attackers can intentionally cause failed payments, e.g., to infer private information (like channel balances), without any cost in fees. In this paper, we first use extensive form games to formally characterize the conditions that lead to rational intermediaries refusing (or agreeing) to forward payments. An intermediary’s decision to forward or not depends on the probability of failure, which they approximate based on past experience. We then propose and analyze an alternative fee model that allows the sender to determine and pay a fraction of the fee to intermediaries in a non-refundable manner. A rational sender chooses the fraction such that the intermediaries’ utility for forwarding the payment exceeds their utility for not forwarding. Our simulation study, based on real-world Lightning snapshots, confirms that our novel mechanism can increase the probability of successful payments by 12% and decrease routing fees for senders by about 6% if all nodes behave rationally. Furthermore, previously costfree probing attacks now require that the attacker pays 1500 satoshis for every 1 million satoshis inferred. Finally, we propose a modification to the Hash Time Locked Contract to enable secure payments of the non-refundable fees.",

RESTful and RPC APIs are among the most common API architectures used. In the last decades, researchers have proposed various techniques for automated testing of RESTful APIs, however, to the best of the authors’ knowledge there exists no work on testing JSON-RPC (one of the two data formats supported by RPC) APIs. To address this limitation, we propose a grammar-based evolutionary fuzzing approach for testing JSON-RPC APIs that uses a novel black-box heuristic. Specifically, we use a diversity-based fitness function based on hierarchical clustering to quantity the differences in API method responses. Our hypothesis is that responses that are unlike previously seen ones are an indication that new uncovered code paths are reached. We evaluate our approach on the XRP ledger, a large-scale industrial blockchain system that uses JSON-RPC APIs. Our results show that the proposed approach performs significantly better than the baseline (grammar-based fuzzer) and covers an additional 240 branches.",

Dynamically typed languages like JavaScript, however, do not have this type information. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised probabilistic type inference approach to infer data types within the test case generation process. We evaluated the proposed approach on a benchmark of 98 units under test (i.e., exported classes and functions) compared to random type sampling w.r.t. branch coverage. Our results show that our type inference approach achieves a statistically significant increase in 56% of the test files with up to 71% of branch coverage compared to the baseline.",

These important advances for security and privacy create new content moderation challenges for online services, because services can no longer directly access plaintext content. While ongoing public policy debates about E2EE and content moderation in the United States and European Union emphasize child sexual abuse material and misinformation in messaging and storage, we identify and synthesize a wealth of scholarship that goes far beyond those topics. We bridge literature that is diverse in both content moderation subject matter, such as malware, spam, hate speech, terrorist content, and enterprise policy compliance, as well as intended deployments, including not only privacy-preserving content moderation for messaging, email, and cloud storage, but also private introspection of encrypted web traffic by middleboxes. In this work, we systematize the study of content moderation in E2EE settings. We set out a process pipeline for content moderation, drawing on a broad interdisciplinary literature that is not specific to E2EE. We examine cryptography and policy design choices at all stages of this pipeline, and we suggest areas of future research to fill gaps in literature and better understand possible paths forward.",

In this work, we propose a new approach to the foregone conclusion doctrine from Fisher v. U.S. that governs the answer to this question. The Holy Grail of this line of work would be a framework for reasoning about whether the testimony implicit in any action is already known to the government. In this paper we attempt something narrower. We introduce a framework for specifying actions for which all implicit testimony is, constructively, a foregone conclusion. Our approach is centered around placing the burden of proof on the government to demonstrate that it is not \"rely[ing] on the truthtelling\" of the respondent. Building on original legal analysis and using precise computer science formalisms, we propose demonstrability as a new central concept for describing compelled acts. We additionally provide a language for whether a compelled action meaningfully entails the respondent to perform in a manner that is 'as good as' the government's desired goal. Then, we apply our definitions to analyze the compellability of several cryptographic primitives including decryption, multifactor authentication, commitment schemes, and hash functions. In particular, our framework reaches a novel conclusion about compelled decryption in the setting that the encryption scheme is deniable: the government can compel but the respondent is free to use any password of her choice.",

While these advances promote improved accessibility and convenience, traditional finance shortcomings like lack of transparency and moral hazard frictions continue to plague centralized platforms, imposing societal costs.\n \n In this monograph, we argue how these shortcomings and frictions may be mitigated by the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. We delve into the workings of smart contracts, the backbone of DeFi transactions, with an emphasis on those underpinning token exchange and lending services.\n \n We highlight the pros and cons of the novel form of decentralized governance introduced via the ownership of governance tokens. We argue that the current DeFi infrastructure introduces operational risks to users, which we segment into five primary categories: consensus mechanisms, protocol, oracle, frontrunning, and systemic risks.\n \n We conclude by emphasizing the need for future research to focus on the scalability of existing blockchains, the improved design and interoperability of DeFi protocols, and the rigorous auditing of smart contracts.",

    "abstract": "Amidst the acceleration of digital transformation across various sectors, the financial market is increasingly focusing on the development of digital and electronic payment methods, including currency. Among these, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) are emerging as future digital currencies that could replace physical cash. They are stable, not subject to value fluctuation, and can be exchanged one-to-one with existing physical currencies. Recently, both domestic and international efforts are underway in researching and developing CBDCs. However, current CBDC systems face scalability issues such as delays in processing large transactions, response times, and network congestion. To build a universal CBDC system, it is crucial to resolve these scalability issues, including the low throughput and network overload problems inherent in existing blockchain technologies. Therefore, this study proposes a solution based on reinforcement learning for handling large-scale data in a CBDC environment, aiming to improve throughput and reduce network congestion. The proposed technology can increase throughput by more than 64 times and reduce network congestion by over 20% compared to existing systems.",

Our design probe, DreamSheets, supports user-composed exploration strategies with LLM-assisted prompt construction and large-scale simultaneous display of generated results, hosted in a spreadsheet interface. Two studies, a preliminary lab study and an extended two-week study where five expert artists developed custom TTI sheet-systems, reveal various strategies for targeted TTI design space exploration—such as using templated text generation to define and layer semantic “axes” for exploration. We identified patterns in exploratory structures across our participants’ sheet-systems: configurable exploration “units” that we distill into a UI mockup, and generalizable UI components to guide future interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Pay-as-you-go (PAYGo) financing is a novel financial contract that has recently become a popular form of credit, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). PAYGo financing relies on technology that enables the lender to cheaply and remotely disable the flow benefits of collateral when the borrower misses payments. This paper quantifies the welfare implications of PAYGo financing. We develop a dynamic structural model of consumers and estimate the model using a multi-arm, large-scale pricing experiment conducted by a fintech lender that offers PAYGo financing for smartphones. We find that the welfare gain from access to PAYGo financing is equivalent to a 5.8% increase in income while remaining highly profitable for the lender. The welfare gains are larger for low-risk and intermediate-income consumers. Under reasonable assumptions about the repossession technology, PAYGo financing consistently outperforms traditional secured loans. For riskier consumers, an intermediate degree of lockout can be welfare maximizing.",

    "abstract": "Modern software development involves collaborative efforts and reuse of existing code, which reduces the cost of developing new software. However, reusing code from existing packages exposes coders to vulnerabilities in these dependencies. We study the formation of dependency networks among software packages and libraries, guided by a structural model of network formation with observable and unobservable heterogeneity. We estimate costs, benefits, and link externalities of the network of 696,790 directed dependencies between 35,473 repositories of the Rust programming language using a novel scalable algorithm. We find evidence of a positive externality exerted on other coders when coders create dependencies. Furthermore, we show that coders are likely to link to more popular packages of the same software type but less popular packages of other types. We adopt models for the spread of infectious diseases to measure a package's systemicness as the number of downstream packages a vulnerability would affect. Systemicness is highly skewed with the most systemic repository affecting almost 90% of all repositories only two steps away. Lastly, we show that protecting only the ten most important repositories reduces vulnerability contagion by nearly 40%.",

However, these devices cannot run complicated security algorithms locally due to hardware restrictions. Data must be transferred to cloud nodes for processing, giving attackers an entry point. This research investigates distributed computing on the edge, using AI-enabled IoT devices and container orchestration tools to process data in real time at the network edge. The purpose is to identify and mitigate DDoS assaults while minimizing CPU usage to improve security. It compares typical IoT devices with and without AI-enabled chips, container orchestration, and assesses their performance in running machine learning models with different cluster settings. The proposed architecture aims to empower IoT devices to process data locally, minimizing the reliance on cloud transmission and bolstering security in IoT environments. The results correlate with the update in the architecture. With the addition of AI-enabled IoT device and container orchestration, there is a difference of 60% between the new architecture and traditional architecture where only Raspberry Pi were being used.",

FrontDef monitors each transaction in the pending transaction pool to detect potential attacks. For each suspicious transaction, FrontDef analyzes the bytecode of the contract the transaction attempts to interact with and assembles a sequence of mimic transactions to replicate the attack strategy. FrontDef then uses the assembled transactions to front-run the suspicious attack transaction to prevent financial loss. Empirical results show that FrontDef can successfully detect and assemble mimic transactions for all of the 24 benchmark cases, including 21 historical attacks that occurred on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). They also confirm that FrontDef can process up to 1230 transactions per second, which is currently greater than the maximum throughput.",

OVer firstly performs symbolic analysis on the given contract and constructs a model of constraints. Then, the framework leverages an SMT solver to identify parameters that allow its secure operation. Furthermore, guard statements may be generated for smart contracts that may use the oracle values, thus effectively preventing oracle manipulation attacks. Empirical results show that OVer can successfully analyze all 10 benchmarks collected, which encompass a diverse range of DeFi protocols. Additionally, this paper also illustrates that current parameters utilized in the majority of benchmarks are inadequate to ensure safety when confronted with significant oracle deviations.",

    "abstract": "Significant efforts have been dedicated to employing model-checking as a formal verification approach in the context of smart contracts. The utilization of these tools necessitates an in-depth knowledge on the part of the developer regarding both the programming language and the implementation of model-checking techniques. To provide accessibility to developers with basic language proficiency, we present a technique for developing a conversational application framework that can be seamlessly linked with any model-checking tool for the purpose of creating a smart contract. This architecture offers a robust and effective approach to the development of safe and dependable smart contracts. The utilization of natural language processing techniques in conjunction with neural networks is employed for this objective. Using this methodology, a prototype implementation for Move smart contracts has been created and is used with the VeriMove model-checking tool. Using the offered graphical user interface, we were able to successfully build, compile and test Move smart contracts across four different classes of smart contracts. This strategy effectively decreases the amount of time and effort needed for manual coding and debugging. In addition, the use of the VeriMove model-checking tool guarantees that the smart contracts produced are devoid of any potential vulnerabilities and flaws.",

    "abstract": "The Move language provides superior security and verifiability compared to existing smart contract languages such as Solidity. As the language becomes more popular, gas optimization will become an important field of research. This paper presents the first work on gas optimization in the Move language. We chose Aptos as the underlying platform for our analysis since it is the leading Move-enabled blockchain platform, and it was the first to develop a gas meter. In this paper, we describe Aptos' gas meter in detail. Then, we analyze the vast research on gas optimization in Solidity, and explore how it can be implemented in the Move language. Finally, this paper proposes 11 gas optimization patterns and principles for the Move language, presents 5 patterns that decrease the time complexity of the smart contract but have no effect on gas consumption, and implements a sample smart contract for each proposed gas optimization pattern. Our results show that the proposed patterns reduce gas consumption in a typical smart contract by 7 – 56%",

    "abstract": "This paper presents DEEPER, a design for a decentralized exchange that enhances the average active liquidity via reserve sharing. By doing this, it addresses the problem of shallow liquidity in low trading volume token pairs. DEEPER allows liquidity providers of multiple trading pairs against a common token to share liquidity. This is achieved by creating a common reserve pool for the shared token that is accessible by each trading pair. Independent from the shared liquidity, providers are free to add liquidity to individual token pairs without any restriction. The trading between one token pair does not affect the price of other token pairs even though the reserve of the shared token changes. The proposed design is an extension of concentrated liquidity market maker-based DEXs that is simple enough to be implemented on smart contracts. Experiments show that for a batch consisting of 8 trading pairs, DEEPER enhances liquidity by over 2.6−5.9×. This enhancement in liquidity can be increased further by increasing participating tokens in the shared pool.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents Mobius, the first cost-efficient state sharding design that remains consensus mechanism agnostic and guarantees atomicity for cross-shard smart contract transactions. In particular, to address the challenges posed by the growing blockchain state, Mobius enables its participants to verify all transactions while only storing a partial state. Unlike previous state sharding systems, the proposed protocol uses a novel vector commitment data structure to reduce the network bandwidth overhead via proof aggregation. Further, it utilizes a novel epoch-based multi-phase commitment technique for guaranteeing atomicity in cross-shard transactions. Experiments presented here show that Mobius reduces the disk requirement of each participant linearly with respect to the number of shards. Further, it presents a 4.7-7.3x lower network bandwidth overhead when compared to existing state-of-the-art state sharding systems. The outcomes also confirm that existing smart contracts can operate on Mobius in cross-shard scenarios without modifications.",

LMPTs keep smaller intermediary tries in memory to alleviate read and write amplification from high-latency disk storage. As an additional feat, they also allow for the I/O and transaction verifier threads to be scheduled in parallel and independently. LMPTs can ultimately reduce significant I/O traffic that happens on the critical path of transaction processing. Empirical results show that LMPTs can process up to ×6 more transactions per second on real-life ERC20 smart contract workloads when compared to existing Ethereum clients.",

    "abstract": "In order for the metaverse to achieve its full potential, access to data from the physical world is required. The Internet of Things is a potential data provider, but a widely adopted marketplace to enable data monetization and trade with the metaverse does not yet exist. One of the reasons is the level of trust between the participants regarding the integrity of the exchanged data. In this paper, a reputation system is proposed that aims to alleviate this problem by providing a mechanism to ensure the validity of the traded data. Under this system, every seller is assigned a score, which buyers can use later to make informed decisions while ensuring it is economically disadvantageous for illicit actors to manipulate the scores. A dispute resolution scheme is also presented that acts as a fail-safe mechanism to further establish trust in this system, along with a proof-of-concept prototype of the proposed reputation system. Empirical results in this paper show the feasibility of the proposed system and provide insight in its behaviour with respect to its parameters.",

Our analysis focuses on traditional firms whose core business is unrelated to blockchain or cryptocurrency. We find that the aggregate market reaction around these events is slightly positive but statistically insignificant for most event windows. However, when we perform heterogeneity analyses, we observe significant differences in market reaction between events with high (larger CARs) and low cryptocurrency exposure (lower CARs). Multivariate regressions show that the level of exposure to cryptocurrency (\"skin in the game\") is a critical factor underlying abnormal returns around the event. Further analyses reveal that economically meaningful acquisitions of BTC or ETH (relative to the firm’s total assets) drive the observed effect. Our findings have important implications for managers, investors, and analysts as they shed light on the relationship between cryptocurrency adoption and firm value.",

    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving domain of digital finance, the interplay between cryptocurrencies and external variables such as financial and social media indicators warrants thorough examination. This investigation employs a novel, entropy-weighted Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) model to decipher these intricate relationships. The study’s foundation is an expansive dataset, meticulously compiled to encompass a broad spectrum of financial data alongside diverse social media indicators. Central to this analysis is the employment of the Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) method, meticulously applied to ascertain the relative importance of various social media indicators. Complementing this, the Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS) methodology is adeptly utilized to derive utility functions for each cryptocurrency under scrutiny. The analytical prowess of neural network regressions is harnessed to delineate the influence exerted by a multitude of financial indicators on these utility functions. The findings of this research are pivotal in understanding the dynamics within the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin and Ripple emerge as pivotal entities, primarily functioning as primary conduits for market shocks. In contrast, Ethereum is identified as a stabilizing force, predominantly absorbing such fluctuations. A nuanced aspect of this study is the differential impact of social media indicators on various cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum display a negative correlation with these indicators, suggesting a complex, possibly inverse relationship with social media dynamics. Conversely, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Ripple exhibit a positive responsiveness, indicating a heightened susceptibility to social media attention, sentiment, and prevailing uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "\"This paper proposes a new investment strategy in the cryptocurrency market based on a two-step procedure. The first step is the computation of the asset’s levels of efficiency in a universe of cryptocurrencies. Price returns efficiency degrees are measured by their corresponding levels of multifractality, obtained by the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis method. The higher the multifractality, the higher the inefficiency in terms of the weak form of market efficiency. Cryptocurrencies are then ranked in terms of efficiency. The second step is the construction of portfolios under the Markowitz framework composed of the most/least efficient digital coins. Minimum variance, maximum Sharpe ratio, equally weighted, and (in)efficient-based portfolios were considered. The former strategy is also proposed, where the weights are computed proportionally to the assets' levels of (in)efficiency. The main findings are: cryptocurrency price returns are multifractal, and their levels of (in)efficiency change over time; returns exhibit left-sided asymmetry, which implies that subsets of large fluctuations contribute substantially to the multifractal spectrum; in bull markets, portfolios with the least efficient assets provided a better risk–return relation; in periods of high volatility and high price depreciation (bear market), a better performance is associated with the portfolios composed of the more efficient cryptocurrencies.\"",

Since the balances are functions of time, methods from functional data analysis are applied; more specifically, the features of the proposed classification model are the functional principal components of the data. Classifying bitcoin addresses is a relevant problem for two main reasons: to understand the composition of the bitcoin market, and to identify addresses used for illicit activities. Although other bitcoin classifiers have been proposed, they focus primarily on network analysis rather than curve behavior. The proposed approach, on the other hand, does not require any network information for prediction. Furthermore, functional features have the advantage of being straightforward to build, unlike expert-built features. Results show improvement when combining functional features with scalar features, and similar accuracy for the models using those features separately, which points to the functional model being a good alternative when domain-specific knowledge is not available.",

    "abstract": "Traditional voting systems mainly comprise of paper polling, electronic ballot system (EVM),\nmechanical devices, etc., and demand the physical presence of the voters. In the new age of digitization,\nthe electronic voting system has come up with a unique facility to cast votes from any discreet place.\nHowever, the e-voting system has to face several challenges regarding security and privacy. To overcome\nsuch obstructions, blockchain is introduced in e-voting applications that preserve anonymity, security,\nand consistency of voter-related information with the help of Merkle tree and hash digest. Hence, any\ndiscrepancy can immediately be detected whenever the hash values of the respective block have been\nmodified and consequently, the whole block is discarded. In this research, a novel e-voting scheme is\nproposed following the decentralized service-oriented architecture of Exonum private blockchain, hybrid\nconsensus algorithm, and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Helmen (ECDH) protocol to agree upon a secure session\nkey among different participants. Moreover, the proposed scheme (ECC-EXONUM-eVOTING) employs\na zero-knowledge protocol and is customized to work over idemix technologies with a blind signature\nscheme. Numerous well-known cryptographic attacks are analyzed formally using the probabilistic random\noracle model and informally for validating the security strength of ECC-EXONUM-eVOTING. As a result,\nit is found that the proposed scheme is well-defended against all potential security concerns. Furthermore,\nthe scheme is simulated using both Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications\n(AVISPA) and Scyther tools to demonstrate the proposed scheme is not prone to any security attacks.\nFinally, it is concluded that the proposed scheme is well-suited for secure e-voting applications.",

IIoT having interconnected machines along with devices can monitor,\ngather, exchange, and analyze information. Since the communication among the entities in IIoT environment\ntakes place insecurely (for instance, wireless communications and Internet), an intruder can easily tamper\nwith the data. Moreover, physical theft of IoT smart devices provides an intruder to mount impersonation\nand other attacks. To handle such critical issues, in this work, we design a new private blockchain-envisioned\naccess control scheme for Pervasive Edge Computing (PEC) in IIoT environment, called PBACS-PECIIoT.\nWe consider the private blockchain consisting of the transactions and registration credentials of the entities\nrelated to IIoT, because the information is strictly confidential and private. The security of PBACS-PECIIoT\nis significantly improved due to usage of blockchain as immutability, transparency and decentralization\n\nalong with protection of various potential attacks. A meticulous comparative analysis exhibits that PBACS-\nPECIIoT achieves greater security and more functionality features, and requires low costs for communica-\ntion and computational as compared to other pertinent schemes.",

However, storage and sharing of PHRs still remains a difficult butnecessary task, especially when health data is one of the major targets of cyberattacks worldwide. Searchable Encryption (SE) is a feasible solution for thisproblem and can be augmented by Blockchain to address some of its issues,such as verifiability. Therefore, SE using blockchain is a promising technolo-gies to tackle the challenge of PHR storage and sharing. In this survey, we haveexplored the research works that use SE and blockchain technology for thesame. The work starts with an introduction of cloud, searchable encryption andblockchain. Subsequently, we present a literature survey of the correspondingtechnologies. We then describe SE in detail and how it fits with blockchain. Thisis followed by description of noteworthy existing solutions for secure storage andsharing of PHRs. Even though there have been a number of surveys related toSE, none of them have surveyed the use of blockchain with SE or use of SE andblockchain in PHR sharing. The work concludes with a comparative study ofthese existing solutions and future scope in this direction",

    "abstract": "—Recent advances in Internet technology and IoT devices have facilitated researchers to foster a wide range of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that improve the quality\nof automated transportation by addressing real-time safety and\ntraffic management issues. The participating ITS agents, such as\nsmart cars and roadside equipment, are required to communicate\nurgently through an open (unsecured) wireless channel in an unattended setting. To address the security issues, several vehicle-tovehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) authentication\nand access control protocols have been proposed in recent times.\nHowever, fast-moving vehicles need to set up frequent authentication with different roadside units, which induces high computation\nand communication overheads. Consequently, it becomes a bottleneck for the resource-limited vehicle onboard unit devices. As the\nblockchain supports decentralized storage with data integrity and\ntransparency, in this article, we design a secure and lightweight\nInternet of Vehicles (IoV)-enabled blockchain-based access control protocol with a handover authentication facility (we call it\nBACHP-IoV, in short). The handover authentication mechanism\nexploits no computation-costly cryptographic primitives. Once the\ntransactions or messages have been securely gathered by a roadside\nunit (RSU), RSUj , residing in a group of vehicles V hi, will form\na partial block, which is later forwarded to a cloud server node in the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud servers blockchain network for\nconverting it into a full block. Next, the full blocks are mined using\na voting-based consensus algorithm. In addition, the in-charge\ntrusted authority T A uploads information about the registered\nvehicles, such as randomized masked passwords and random secrets, to the blockchain. Thus, an RSUj can check the authenticity\nof a particular vehicle as well. We prove the security strength of the\nproposed BACHP-IoV by using the well-known Real-or-Random\n(ROR)-based random oracle model, the ProVerif 2.03 simulation\ntool, and informal security analysis. We have implemented the\nproposed BACHP-IoV through network simulator 3 (NS-3) and\nblockchain, and the simulation results demonstrate that BACHPIoV is practical in a real-life scenario. A detailed comparative\nanalysis also shows that BACHP-IoV provides significantly better\nsecurity and efficiency than the existing competing schemes.",

The integration of the physical and digital domains is crucial for unlocking the full potential of the IIoT, and digital twins can facilitate this integration by providing a virtual representation of real-world entities. Objectives:: By combining digital twins with the IIoT, industries can simulate, predict, and control physical behaviors, enabling them to achieve broader value and support industry 4.0 and 5.0. Constituents of\ncooperative IIoT domains tend to interact and collaborate during their complicated operations.\nMethods:: To secure such interaction and collaborations, we introduce a blockchain-based cross-domain\nauthentication protocol for IIoT. The blockchain maintains only each domain’s dynamic accumulator,\nwhich accumulates crucial materials derived from devices, decreasing the overhead. In addition, we\nuse the on-chain accumulator to effectively validate the unlinkable identities of cross-domain IIoT\ndevices.\nResults:: The implementation of the concept reveals the fact that our protocol is efficient and reliable.\nThis efficiency and reliability of our protocol is also substantiated through comparison with state-ofthe-art literature. In contrast to related protocols, our protocol exhibits a minimum 22.67% increase in\ncomputation cost efficiency and a 16.35% rise in communication cost efficiency.\nConclusion:: The developed protocol guarantees data transfer security across the domain and thwarts IoT\ndevices from potential physical attacks. Additionally, in order to protect privacy, anonymity and unlinkability are also guaranteed.",

Due to the high value of personal health information, PHRs are one of the favourite targets of cyber attackers worldwide. Over the years, many solutions have been proposed; however, most solutions are inefficient for practical applications. For instance, several existing schemes rely on the bilinear pairings, which incur high computational costs. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel PHR-sharing scheme that is dynamic, efficient, and practical. Specifically, we combine searchable symmetric encryption, blockchain technology and a decentralized storage system, known as Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) to guarantee confidentiality of PHRs, verifiability of search results, and forward security. Moreover, we provide formal security proofs for the proposed scheme. Finally, we have conducted extensive test-bed experiments and the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can be used in practical scenarios related to IoMT environment.",

    "abstract": "One of the most significant recent advances in technology is the advent of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), i.e., drones. They have widened the scope of possible applications and provided a platform for a wide range of creative responses to a variety of challenges. The Internet of Drones (IoD) is a relatively new concept that has arisen as a consequence of the combination of drones and the Internet. The fifth-generation (5G) and beyond cellular networks (i.e., drones in networks beyond 5G) are promising solutions for achieving safe drone operations and applications. They may have many applications, like surveillance or urban areas, security, surveillance, retaliation, delivering items, smart farming, film production, capturing nature videos, and many more. Due to the fact that it is susceptible to a wide variety of cyber-attacks, there are certain concerns regarding the privacy and security of IoD communications. In this paper, a secure blockchain-enabled authentication key management framework with the big data analytics feature for drones in networks beyond 5G applications is proposed (in short, SBBDA-IoD). The security of SBBDA-IoD against multiple attacks is demonstrated through a detailed security analysis. The Scyther tool is used to perform a formal security verification test on the SBBDA-IoD’s security, confirming the system’s resistance to various potential attacks. A detailed comparative analysis has identified that SBBDA-IoD outperforms the other schemes by a significant margin. Finally, a real-world implementation of SBBDA-IoD is shown to evaluate its effect on several measures of performance.",

    "abstract": "Recently, with the increasing application of the Internet of Things (IoT), various IoT\nenvironments such as smart factories, smart homes, and smart grids are being generated. In the\nIoT environment, a lot of data are generated in real time, and the generated IoT data can be used\nas source data for various services such as artificial intelligence, remote medical care, and finance,\nand can also be used for purposes such as electricity bill generation. Therefore, data access control\nis required to grant access rights to various data users in the IoT environment who need such IoT\ndata. In addition, IoT data contain sensitive information such as personal information, so privacy\nprotection is also essential. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) technology has\nbeen utilized to address these requirements. Furthermore, system structures applying blockchains\nwith CP-ABE are being studied to prevent bottlenecks and single failures of cloud servers, as well as\nto support data auditing. However, these systems do not stipulate authentication and key agreement\nto ensure the security of the data transmission process and data outsourcing. Accordingly, we\npropose a data access control and key agreement scheme using CP-ABE to ensure data security in a\nblockchain-based system. In addition, we propose a system that can provide data nonrepudiation,\ndata accountability, and data verification functions by utilizing blockchains. Both formal and informal\nsecurity verifications are performed to demonstrate the security of the proposed system. We also\ncompare the security, functional aspects, and computational and communication costs of previous\nsystems. Furthermore, we perform cryptographic calculations to analyze the system in practical\nterms. As a result, our proposed protocol is safer against attacks such as guessing attacks and tracing\nattacks than other protocols, and can provide mutual authentication and key agreement functions. In\naddition, the proposed protocol is more efficient than other protocols, so it can be applied to practical\nIoT environments.",

    "abstract": "The growth of IoT devices is so rapid that several billions of such devices would be in use in a span of four-year period. Essential security mechanisms need to be put in place to curb several security attacks prevalent in IoT. Access control is an important security mechanism that ensures legitimate and controlled access to critical and limited resources in IoT. The current access control schemes for IoT could not handle burgeoning number of IoT devices, while meeting the necessary level of security. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a new scalable and secure access control scheme for IoT. With blockchain as the root-of-trust, the proposed scheme performs access control for the IoT devices without having the resource-constrained IoT devices to be part of the blockchain network and to possess substantial amount of blockchain data. Blockchain’s tamper-proof property makes it an ideal candidate to be chosen as the root-of-trust. The scheme is secure against various security attacks prevalent in IoT. A proof-of-concept implementation for the scheme is developed and deployed in Ethereum Mainnet. The transaction costs of the different operations in the scheme are fairly below USD 3. Furthermore, scalability of the proposed scheme in different scenarios is investigated.",

In particular, a UAV-enabled ITS can be realized through the\ncombination of traditional vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) and UAVs that can act as flying roadside\nunits (RSUs) at the outskirts and monitor road conditions from predefined locations to spot car accidents\nand any law violations. Notably, to realize these services, real-time communication between UAVs and\nRSUs must be guaranteed. However, UAVs have limited computing powers, and if extensive computation is\nrequired during communication, the provision of real-time ITS services may be hindered. Furthermore, UAVs\nand RSUs communicate via public channels that are prone to various attacks, such as replay, impersonation,\ntrace, and session key disclosure attacks. Thus, in this article, a secure and lightweight authentication scheme\nis proposed for UAVs and RSUs using the blockchain technology. The proposed scheme is analyzed using\ninformal and formal methods including Burrows–Abadi–Nikoogadam (BAN) logic, automated validation of\ninternet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) simulation tool, and real–or–random (RoR) model,\nand its performance is compared with that of related schemes.

However, these services are susceptible to various security attacks because sensitive data\nare exchanged through an open channel. Thus, a secure authentication scheme is essential for UAV. UAV\nhas limited storage resources and computing capabilities. To overcome these problems, cloud computing is\nconsidered as a promising solution. Cloud computing provides various properties such as storage availability\nand scalability. Unfortunately, the cloud server’s database can be a major target for an adversary because it is\na centralized system. If an adversary intrudes on the cloud server’s database, he/she may attempt to intercept\nor learn the stored data. To mitigate these issues, we design a secure and lightweight authentication and\nkey agreement scheme for cloud-assisted UAV using blockchain in flying ad-hoc networks, called LAKA-UAV.\nLAKA-UAV utilizes blockchain technology to ensure access control and data integrity using log transactions\nand the cloud server securely manages collected data from UAV. We prove the security of LAKA-UAV based on\ninformal security analysis and formal security verification implementation. Based on testbed experiments using\nMIRACL, LAKA-UAV provides about 2.13 times more efficient performance on average compared with related\nschemes in terms of computation. We present the blockchain implementation using Hyperledger Sawtooth\nplatform.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the Digital Twin (DT) technology has procured a lot of attention because of its applicability in the manufacturing and space industries. The DT environment involves the formation of a clone of the tangible object to perform simulations in the virtual space. The combination of conceptual development, predictive maintenance, real-time monitoring, and simulation characteristics of DT has increased the utilization of DT in different scenarios, such as medical environments, healthcare, manufacturing industries, aerospace, etc. However, these utilizations have also brought serious security pitfalls in DT deployment. Towards this, several authentication protocols with different security and privacy features for DT environments have been proposed. In this article, we first review a recently proposed two-factor authentication protocol for DT environments that utilizes the blockchain technology. However, the analyzed scheme is unable to offer the desirable security and cannot withstand various security attacks like offline password-guessing attack, smart card stolen attack, anonymity property, and known session-specific temporary information attack. We also demonstrate that an attacker can impersonate the analyzed protocol’s legal user, owner, and cloud server. To mitigate these security loopholes, we devise an effective three-factor privacy-preserving authentication scheme for DT environments. The proposed work is demonstrated to be secure by performing the informal security analysis, the formal security analysis using the widely recognized Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, and the Real-or-Random (ROR) model. A detailed comparative study on existing competing schemes including the analyzed scheme demonstrates that the devised framework furnishes better security features while also having lower computation costs and comparable communication costs than the existing schemes.",

    "abstract": "Designing a secure and efficient authentication protocol is crucial and challenging in the mobility network.\nDue to the seamless roaming of mobile users over multiple foreign agents and the broadcast nature of the\ncommunication channel, the mobile networks are often exposed to several network attacks. To achieve perfect\nauthentication and secure communication among mobility entities like MU (Mobile User), FA (Foreign Agent)\nand HA (Home Agent), the researchers have proposed numerous authentication protocols in the past. However,\nthe existing protocols for the mobility environments are insufficient to address the fundamental security\nconcerns and an adversary can impersonate the mobile user at anytime. Thus, we propose Mobile-Chain, a\n\nsecure blockchain-based authentication system for mobility environments. The proposed Mobile-Chain is de-\nsigned to protect user privacy and guarantees provable security like authentication, anonymity, untraceability,\n\nconfidentiality, data integrity, and decentralization. The implementation of the security framework has been\ndone on the ethereum blockchain platform using smart contracts written in a solidity programming language.\nThe security analysis reveals that Mobile-Chain is robust against various security threats to which mobility\nnetworks are vulnerable. Besides, the authentication framework has been measured through a formal security\nverification tool known as Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocol and Application (AVISPA).\nNotably, the performance evaluation of the proposed protocol proves that it maintains performance gain,\ncomputationally efficient, and implementable in resource-limited wireless and mobility environments.",

    "abstract": "Distributed ledger technology, such as blockchains, is changing financial markets by creating the foundation for transacting with digital assets. New blockchain-enabled intermediaries—cryptoexchanges—have emerged to trade, broker, and settle transactions with digital assets, including innovative cryptoassets and other tokenized assets. U.S. regulators seek to place cryptoexchanges within the ambit of existing regulation and registration requirements for legacy exchanges. A critical underexplored corollary of this approach is converting cryptoexchanges into registered self-regulatory organizations (SROs) or members of legacy SROs, such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Put differently, a byproduct of the regulatory efforts to register the new digital asset intermediaries is bringing legacy self-regulation into blockchain-enabled markets. Unfortunately, in imposing this model without reform, policymakers continue to ignore the considerable economic potential of digital assets and blockchains. The regulators also fail to incorporate the economic gains from the technology, properly control its negative externalities, and ultimately produce economic welfare-improving outcomes. \n\nThis Article aims to offer solutions. It delves into the digital asset market structure and microstructure, the new intermediaries, their risks and economic benefits, and associated transaction costs. It shows why technology alone cannot optimally address the risks and costs of digital asset trading. Agreeing with the regulators’ intuition to introduce formal self-regulation, the Article outlines an improved self-regulatory model. The proposed self-regulatory approach would aggregate the decentralized knowledge of individual participants in the global blockchain-enabled market to ensure well-informed and efficient regulation. Building on market expertise, the SRO would educate the regulators about ongoing market developments, mitigate the information asymmetry between the agencies and the markets, and reduce coordination costs among heterogeneous and dispersed developers in blockchain-enabled markets.\n\nNamely, the Article proposes a two-tier SRO structure to oversee the digital asset market. The base layer of this model would be the centralized trading platforms themselves. The upper policy-level layer would develop comprehensive rules and coordination mechanisms for centralized exchanges and digital asset broker-dealers. To address global spillovers between trading on centralized and decentralized exchanges, the policy-level SRO would also develop guidelines and best practices for decentralized exchanges built directly on blockchains. The Article illustrates why blockchain-native methods cannot control the risks of decentralized exchanges and suggests coordinating developer activity through guidelines to nudge the market to design technological solutions to transactional and regulatory problems. The proposed self-regulatory model considers the global interconnections within the centralized and decentralized digital asset infrastructure and addresses its risks in a coordinated and comprehensive manner.",

    "abstract": "In 2022, the White House released a regulatory framework calling for a whole-of-government approach to digital asset innovations. Although justified and necessary, this systems-based strategy discounts the reality that U.S. financial regulation is fundamentally fragmented. There are signs of a turf war between the major digital asset regulators (the SEC and the CFTC). Both agencies claim jurisdiction over overlapping classes of digital assets, and several congressional bills recently proposed to radically redistribute this jurisdiction. Policy reforms under the conditions of regulatory fragmentation need empirical data comparing the effect of actions of the regulators involved. Empirical literature on digital asset innovations, however, has not paid sufficient attention to the impact of the U.S.-specific factors such as regulatory fragmentation. Nor has it explored the importance of U.S. regulators to global digital asset markets. We aim to fill this gap, contribute to scholarship on financial innovation, and equip policymakers with necessary empirical data. Our empirical study compares how the SEC and the CFTC regulate crypto primarily via enforcement and how the global digital asset market reacts to the agencies. The market distinguishes between the Commissions and reacts particularly negatively to SEC enforcement. It is erroneous to assume, however, that this is because crypto markets reject formal law or strong enforcement. Digital asset prices exhibit a more positive reaction to U.S.-led antifraud efforts, indicating that investors understand the value of market integrity. The unfavorable reaction to regulation may be explained by who enforces substantive law (the CFTC or the SEC). We provide theoretical explanations and underscore that, while U.S.-led enforcement is generally viewed as costly, some types of regulation may have the potential to improve market quality with positive valuation implications. We hope that our analysis will provide new information to scholars and policymakers in evaluating the merits of financial reforms, addressing the current fragmentation in financial regulation, resolving turf wars, and advancing the efforts to promote a “whole-of-government” approach to digital asset innovation",

These cryptocurrencies can also be acquired in exchange markets. The availability of the historical bookkeeping of cryptocurrency transfers in a public ledger opens up the possibility of understanding the relationship between aggregate users’ behaviour and the cryptocurrency pricing in exchange markets. This paper analyses the properties of the transaction network of Bitcoin. We consider different representations over a period of nine years since its creation and involving 16 million users and 283 million transactions. Importantly, these transactions do not include orders filled in exchange markets, which are settled outside of the blockchain, and ultimately determine Bitcoin price. By analysing these networks, we show the existence of Granger causal relationships between Bitcoin price movements and changes of its transaction network topology. Our results reveal the interplay between structural quantities, indicative of the collective behaviour of Bitcoin users, and price movements, showing that, during price drops, the system is characterised by a larger heterogeneity of users’ activity.",

    "abstract": "This book covers various data scientific approaches to analyze the issue of grid integration of renewable energy for which the grid flexibility is the key to cope with its intermittency. It provides readers with the scope to view renewable energy integration as establishing a distributed energy network instead of the traditional centralized energy system. Specifically, quantitative valuation system-wise of the levelized cost of energy, which includes both initial cost and various operational costs, enables readers to optimize energy systems in order to minimize economic cost and environmental impact. It is noted, however, that the high cost of integrating renewable energy on a large scale might slow economic growth considerably. Topics addressed in the book also include statistical comparative study of the relationship between energy and economic growth, a graphical model of determinant factors for foreign direct investment in renewable energy, the coupled oscillator model and unitcommitment model to capture intermittency of renewable energy, and the network model of evolving micro-grids. The book explains desired innovation to reduce the integration cost significantly using innovative technologies such as energy storage with hydrogen production and vehicle-to-grid technology. Illustrated by careful analysis of selected examples of renewable integration using different types of grid flexibility, this volume is indispensable to readers who make policy recommendations to establish the distributed energy network integrated with large-scale renewable energy by disentangling the nexus of energy, environment, and economic growth",

These developments have the capacity to change the existing financial system fundamentally. This book addresses how technological developments and digitalization will impact the future of financial systems. \n\nThis book is based on the results of a series of ten roundtables with high-level experts on the future of the financial system. Experts from academia, supranational institutions, central banks, commercial banks, regulators, start-ups, technology companies, venture capital firms, think tanks, foundations, and other visionaries from five continents developed potential scenarios of the financial system 2030 over a time horizon of five years. The book presents the results of these discussions, which are structured along the ‘Vaduz Architecture’. This newly introduced concept distinguishes different dimensions for the future financial system, including information technologies, nation states and (de-) regulation.",

In this context, green fintech plays a major role,which, however, is still an unexplored field in business, information systems andfinance research. This paper conducts a systematic literature analysis and develops aresearch agenda based on a framework, which is derived from clustering 74 academicresearch papers. The framework consists of the four clusters strategy, organization,technology, and potentials along nine dimensions. The research agenda reveals thatgreen fintech is still a very premature field of research. The analysis shows that areaslike customer- and government-related services, insurance-oriented approaches andSDGs which focus on life on land and life below water are still rare and that most ofthe approaches focus on blockchain technology, while other financial technologieslike artificial intelligence are still underrepresented.",

    "abstract": "Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are frequently the most relevant element of a company's total emissions since they account for more than eighty percent. However, they are difficult to calculate since many stakeholders in the value chain are involved and emission data are usually not shared among them. Sustainable finance could provide a link to this discussion by providing data, digital data infrastructures and evaluation instruments. However, the existing research today is either limited to analyzing the levels of scope 3 emissions or to calculating them based on different measurement methods. How to implement scope 3 emissions reporting by solving the data sharing challenge remains mainly unexplored. This paper aims to close this gap by developing an approach, which chooses sustainable finance as a connecting element that (1) combines different calculation methods, (2) integrates cross-value chain data from different stakeholders and (3) combines primary and secondary data in a single model. The approach was developed in a prototype that uses real world data from collaboration with the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance to evaluate its applicability. The findings of the prototype indicate that a digital data infrastructure can improve the calculation of scope 3 GHG emissions by improving data availability, accessibility and reliability and at the same time shows that the calculations are only as good as the data, which fuels this calculation. With this, the paper contributes to the theoretical and practical discussion about scope 3 GHG emission data.",

It addresses a critical disadvantage of supply\n\nchain delivery performance models, namely considering a delivery process as a whole and ignor-\ning characteristics and relationships between activities in the delivery process. A delivery process\n\nis modeled using the Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique based on the characteristic func-\ntion (CF-GERT). Based on the CF-GERT model, a framework for applying managerial effort to activities\n\nto improve overall delivery performance is proposed. Then, particle swarm optimization (PSO) based\non the penalty function is used to solve the delivery performance improvement framework. Finally, a\nnumerical case shows how applying efforts to activities can effectively improve delivery performance\nand demonstrates the influence of several parameters on the related costs.",

As high and low prices can be seen\nas interval-value time series, an evolving fuzzy system to model\nand forecast interval data is suggested to capture time varying,\nnonlinear and uncertain dynamics of the cryptocurrency market.\nThe model is composed of fuzzy functional rules in which its\nstructure and functionality are updated as data are input.

Antecedents of the rules are updated using participatory\nlearning to cluster interval-valued time series, and consequents\nare computed using weighted recursive least squares based on\nintervals center and range. In addition to the evaluation of\npredictability through accuracy metrics, a simple trading strategy\nis constructed based on high and low prices forecasts to determine\nentry and exit signals, composing an economic criteria. Empirical\nresults indicated that the fuzzy model is able to produce accurate\nforecasts of high and low prices of BitCoin, and a higher level of\nreturn adjusted by risk is achieved when these forecasts are used\nto perform a trading strategy in comparison with the competitive\napproaches.",

Transactions are simultaneously secure and trustworthy due to the\nuse of cryptographic principles. In recent years, blockchain technology has become very trendy\nand penetrated different domains, mostly due to the popularity of cryptocurrencies. One field\nwhere blockchain technology has tremendous potential is healthcare, due to the need for a more\npatient-centric approach to healthcare systems and to connect disparate systems and increase\nthe accuracy of electronic healthcare records (EHRs). In this systematic review, an analysis of\nstate-of-the-art blockchain research in the field of healthcare is conducted. The aim is to reveal the\npotential applications of the technology and to highlight the challenges and possible directions\nof blockchain research in healthcare. First, background information is discussed, followed by\na description of the exact methodology used in this paper. Next, an analysis of the results is given,\nwhich includes a bibliometric overview, an analysis of gathered data and its properties, and the\nresults of a literature quality assessment. Lastly, there is a discussion of the results from the analysis.\nThe findings indicate that blockchain technology research in healthcare is increasing and it is mostly\nused for data sharing, managing health records and access control. Other scenarios are very rare.\nMost research is aimed at presenting novel structural designs in the form of frameworks, architectures\nor models. Findings also show that technical details about the used blockchain elements are not\ngiven in most of the analyzed publications and that most research does not present any prototype\nimplementation or implementation details. Often even with a prototype implementation, no details\nabout blockchain elements are given.",

It has become increasingly popular in recent years attracting the attention of the individual, investor, media, academia and governments worldwide. This study aims to model and forecast the volatilities and returns of three top cryptocurrencies, namely; Bitcoin, Ethereum and Binance Coin. The data utilized in the study was extracted from the higher market capitalization at 31st December, 2021 and the data for the period starting from 9th November, 2017 to 31st December 2021. The Generalised Autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) type models with several distributions were fitted to the three cryptocurrencies dataset with their performances assessed using some model criteria. The result shows that the mean of all the returns are positive indicating the fact that the price of this three crptocurrencies increase throughout the period of study. The ARCH-LM test shows that there is no ARCH effect in volatility of Bitcoin and Ethereum but present in Binance Coin. The GARCH model was fitted on Binance Coin, the AIC and log L shows that the CGARCH is the best model for Binance Coin. Automatic forecasting was perform based on the selected ARIMA (2,0,1), ARIMA (0,1,2) and the random walk model which has the lowest AIC for ETH-USD, BNB-USD and BTC-USD respectively. This finding could aid investors in determining a cryptocurrency's unique risk-reward characteristics. The study contributes to a better deployment of investor’s resources and prediction of the future prices the three cryptocurrencies.",

This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms\nand elements that drive consumer resistance in this space. Drawing upon the\nstimulus‐organism‐response paradigm and the innovation resistance theory, the\npaper explores how the characteristics of the current cryptocurrency landscape\ncontribute to different factors associated with crypto‐payment rejection. Our\nfindings from empirical and experimental studies reveal how ecosystem volatility and\nthe lack of structural assurances for cryptocurrencies foster negative consumer\nperceptions, leading to resistance against crypto‐payment use. The paper develops\nnew insights into the main predictors of consumer resistance to crypto‐payment,\nwhich is a precursor to the mainstream use of cryptocurrencies. Moreover, it sheds\nlight on the interactions among context‐specific, psychological, and functional\ndeterminants of behavioral consumer response.",

    "abstract": "The evolving landscape of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has raised critical security concerns, especially pertaining to Protocols for Loanable Funds (PLFs) and their dependency on price oracles, which are susceptible to manipulation. The emergence of flash loans has further amplified these risks, enabling increasingly complex oracle manipulation attacks that can lead to significant financial losses. Responding to this threat, we first dissect the attack mechanism by formalizing the standard operational and adversary models for PLFs. Based on our analysis, we propose SecPLF, a robust and practical solution designed to counteract oracle manipulation attacks efficiently. SecPLF operates by tracking a price state for each cryptoasset, including the recent price and the timestamp of its last update. By imposing price constraints on the price oracle usage, SecPLF ensures a PLF only engages a price oracle if the last recorded price falls within a defined threshold, thereby negating the profitability of potential attacks. Our evaluation based on historical market data confirms SecPLF's efficacy in providing high-confidence prevention against arbitrage attacks that arise due to minor price differences. SecPLF delivers proactive protection against oracle manipulation attacks, offering ease of implementation, oracle-agnostic property, and resource and cost efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The capital required to maintain infrastructure in good repair falls short globally. This is commonly referred to as\nthe “infrastructure finance gap”. To address climate change, transitioning from conventional to sustainable\ninfrastructure further imposes financing challenges. This study employs the Model approach to justify and\npredict how blockchain technologies can leverage infrastructure data to close the finance gap by introducing new\nfinancing mechanisms. A semisystematic literature review was carried out for infrastructure finance, sustainable\ninfrastructure and smart cities finance mechanisms, as well as blockchains and oracles. Conventional infrastructure finance via debt and equity lacks benchmarks that reflect the risk-return characteristics of the asset\nclass. Performance-based financing addresses this issue by integrating performance data in valuations. However,\na lack of trust in data veracity remains. Blockchains provide trust and transparency in data and transactions.\nThey utilize oracles to access off-chain information for on-chain decision-making. With smart contracts and\ndecentralized oracle networks, a general approach is presented where data from internet-of-things inform onchain transactions, delivering performance benchmarks that accurately reflect the risk-return characteristics in\nan infrastructure investment. Capital can then be more readily deployed, thus closing the finance gap. An end-toend example of financing sustainable stormwater infrastructure, Open Storm, is also presented.",

    "abstract": "Pay-for-outcome financing mechanisms have been used to address agricultural runoffs to overcome\nthe inefficiencies associated with push-based solutions, which are dependent on subsidies or\nphilanthropic funding. As a market-based approach, pay-for-outcome platforms seek to incentivize\n\nsustainable practices, compensated by beneficiaries of the positive outcomes. Execution of pay-for-\noutcome financing mechanisms in an agriculture context is a complex transaction, involving\n\ninvestors, farmers, third party verifiers of outcomes, government and corporate beneficiaries, and thus\nrequires a costly governance structure. Effective governance mechanisms are needed to meet the\ntransaction costs identified in performance measurements. This study investigates the efficacy of\nblockchain technology to address transaction costs in pay-for-outcome financing for sustainable\nagriculture. Through a proof-of-concept, this study quantifies and explores the potential cost-saving\n\nbenefits of utilizing blockchain. The proof-of-concept is an application of blockchain within a pay-\nfor-outcome incentive model, namely the Soil and Water Outcomes Fund, for sustainable agriculture.\n\nUtilizing the Ethereum blockchain, transactions are facilitated through crypto wallets and a hybrid\nsmart contract, while precipitation is used as a proxy for agricultural runoff measurements. Drawing\nfrom Transaction Cost Economics theory, a discussion is presented on how blockchains can reduce\ntransaction costs, enhancing the governance and efficiency of pay-for-outcome mechanisms.\nFurthermore, the article presents blockchain transaction fees in the context of the scale of operations,\nconsidering the total number of participants in the Soil and Water Outcomes Fund. Our findings\nindicate that blockchain technology has the capacity to simplify intricate transactions, boost\nmeasurement accuracy, cut administrative expenses, and foster trust and transparency among\nstakeholders, thereby reducing the overall transaction costs associated with pay-for-outcome\nincentives. While blockchain has its limitations and is not a universally applicable solution for every\ntype of transaction cost, we believe that blockchains are well-suited to facilitate pay-for-outcome\nfinancing such as the Soil and Water Outcomes Fund.",

    "abstract": "On-chain mixers, such as Tornado Cash (TC), have become a popular privacy solution for many non-privacy-preserving blockchain users. These mixers enable users to deposit a fixed amount of coins and withdraw them to another address, while effectively reducing the linkability between these addresses and securely obscuring their transaction history. However, the high cost of interacting with existing on-chain mixer smart contracts prohibits standard users from using the mixer, mainly due to the use of computationally expensive cryptographic primitives. For instance, the deposit cost of TC on Ethereum is approximately \n gas (i.e., \n USD in June 2023), which is \n higher than issuing a base transfer transaction.\n\n\nIn this work, we introduce the Merkle Pyramid Builder approach, to incrementally build the Merkle tree in an on-chain mixer and update the tree per batch of deposits, which can therefore decrease the overall cost of using the mixer. Our evaluation results highlight the effectiveness of this approach, showcasing a significant reduction of up to \n in the amortized cost of depositing compared to state-of-the-art on-chain mixers. Importantly, these improvements are achieved without compromising users' privacy. Furthermore, we propose the utilization of verifiable computations to shift the responsibility of Merkle tree updates from on-chain smart contracts to off-chain clients, which can further reduce deposit costs. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates that our designs ensure fairness by distributing Merkle tree update costs among clients over time.",

Proof-of-work is the most prominent consensus mechanism, but environmentally unsustainable. Here, we focus on proof-of-stake, its best-known alternative. Importantly, decentralized decision-making power is not an inherent feature of blockchain systems, but a technological possibility. Numerous security incidents illustrate that decentralized control cannot be taken for granted. We therefore study how key parameters affect the degree of decentralization in proof-of-stake blockchain systems. Based on a real-world implementation of a proof-of-stake blockchain system, we conduct agent-based simulations to study how a range of parameters impact decentralization. The results suggest that high numbers of initial potential validator nodes, large transactions, a high number of transactions, and a very high or very low positive validator network growth rate increase decentralization. We find weak support for an impact of changes in transaction fees and initial stake distributions. Our study highlights how blockchain challenges our understanding of decentralization in information systems research, and contributes to understanding the governance mechanisms that lead to decentralization in proof-of-stake blockchain systems as well as to designing proof-of-stake blockchain systems that are prone to decentralization and therefore more secure.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology has enabled the emergence of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)\nwith consensus-based governance. Staking governs DAOs instead of centralized authorities. As a new organizing form, DAOs require careful theoretical consideration. We conceptualize the vehicle of consensusbased governance as digital consensus. Using an agent-based simulation model, this paper aims to extend meta-organization theory to incorporate an organizational learning perspective. We benchmark the\nDAOs using two well-established organizing forms, namely autonomous and hierarchical organizations.\nWe find that hierarchies outperform DAOs in static environments, whereas DAOs outperform hierarchies\nin turbulent environments, with autonomies only excelling with intensive experimentation. Our analyses allow us to characterize DAOs as evolving through a staggered process of polarization and homogenization, as opposed to autonomies’ continuous polarization and hierarchies’ continuous homogenization.\nSuch a staggered process can be affected by several factors (e.g., voting thresholds, token asymmetry, and\ncontributor incentives).",

    "abstract": "Ripple network or the XRP network is one of the most versatile blockchain platforms used worldwide\nfor payment systems, healthcare applications etc. The abstract protocol called XRP ledger consensus protocol\n(XRPL for short) is a refined version of the initial design referred to as Ripple Protocol consensus algorithm\n(RPCA). It is based on the Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) agreement protocol but does not use the standard\nmodels or implementation but utilizes collectively-trusted sub-networks within a large network. Consensus\nis achieved by maintaining a certain level of “trust” for the sub-networks and a certain minimal connectivity\nthroughout the network so that the network can be robust in the face of Byzantine failures. For each server\nin the XRP network called there is sub-network of validators, referrred to as the Unique Node List (UNL)\nconsisting of a subset of the servers of the whole network. To be robust against Byzantine failures, XRPL\nenforces 80% quorum and a certain overlap of nodes across the UNLs. The overlap was initially specified to\nbe 20% and was later enhanced to be greater than 90% to satisfy conditions of safety and liveness. However,\neven with such an enhancement, safety and liveness are not satisfied. In this paper, we characterize, the XRP\nLedger Consensus protocol (abbreviated XRPL) for consensus correctness using a notion of similarity metric\ncalled rand-index (RI) used for cluster analysis of networks. We establish that XRPL with 80% quorum and\nUNLs satisfying 50% RI similarity, is robust against 20% failures, that is, no fraudulent transactions will be\naccepted by the network. Further, the network satisfies consensus correctness if the UNLs of the network are\nmore than 50% RI similar that would imply at least 80% quorum across all the UNLs.",

    "abstract": "With the large increase in the adoption of blockchain technologies, their underlying peer-to-peer networks must also scale with the demand. In this context, previous works highlighted the importance of ensuring efficient and resilient communication for the underlying consensus and replication mechanisms. However, they were mainly focused on mainstream, Proof-of-Workbased Distributed Ledger Technologies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. In this paper, the problem is investigated in the context of consensus-validation based blockchains, like the XRP Ledger. The latter relies on a Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) consensus mechanism which is proven to have a good scalability in regards to transaction throughput. However, it is known that significant increases in the size of the XRP Ledger network would be challenging to achieve. The main reason is the flooding mechanism used to disseminate the messages related to the consensus protocol, which creates many duplicates in the network. Squelching is a recent solution proposed for limiting this duplication, however, it was never evaluated quantitatively in real-life scenarios involving the XRPL production network. In this paper, our aim is to assess this mechanism using a reallife controllable testbed and the XRPL production network, to assess its benefit and compare it to alternative solutions relying on Named Data Networking and on a gossip-based approach.",

However, with the emergence of private pools, attackers can now conceal\ntheir exploit transactions from attack detection. This poses a significant\nchallenge for existing security tools, which primarily rely on monitoring\ntransactions in public mempools. To effectively address this challenge, it\nis crucial to develop proactive methods that predict malicious behavior\nbefore the actual attack transactions occur. In this work, we introduce\na novel methodology to infer potential victims by analyzing the deployment bytecode of malicious smart contracts. Our idea leverages the fact\nthat attackers typically split their attacks into two stages, a deployment\nstage, and an attack stage. This provides a small window to analyze the\nattacker’s deployment code and identify victims in a timely manner before the actual attack occurs. By analyzing a set of past DeFi attacks,\nthis work demonstrates that the victim of an attack transaction can be\nidentified with an accuracy of almost 70%.",

    "abstract": "Crash fault tolerant (CFT) consensus algorithms are commonly used in scenarios where system\ncomponents are trusted—e.g., enterprise settings and government infrastructure. However, CFT\nconsensus can be broken by even a single corrupt node. A desirable property in the face of such\npotential Byzantine faults is accountability: if a corrupt node breaks protocol and affects consensus\nsafety, it should be possible to identify the culpable components with cryptographic integrity from the\nnode states. Today, the best-known protocol for providing accountability to CFT protocols is called\nPeerReview; it essentially records a signed transcript of all messages sent during the CFT protocol.\nBecause PeerReview is agnostic to the underlying CFT protocol, it incurs high communication and\nstorage overhead. We propose CFT-Forensics, an accountability framework for CFT protocols. We\nshow that for a special family of forensics-compliant CFT protocols (which includes widely-used\nCFT protocols like Raft and multi-Paxos), CFT-Forensics gives provable accountability guarantees.\nUnder realistic deployment settings, we show theoretically that CFT-Forensics operates at a fraction\nof the cost of PeerReview. We subsequently instantiate CFT-Forensics for Raft, and implement RaftForensics as an extension to the popular nuRaft library. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate\nthat Raft-Forensics adds low overhead to vanilla Raft. With 256 byte messages, Raft-Forensics\nachieves a peak throughput 87.8% of vanilla Raft at 46% higher latency (+44 ms). We finally\nintegrate Raft-Forensics into the open-source central bank digital currency OpenCBDC, and show\nthat in wide-area network experiments, Raft-Forensics achieves 97.8% of the throughput of Raft,\nwith 14.5% higher latency (+326 ms).",

Although these marketplaces use feedback systems to encourage healthier transactions, anecdotal evidence suggests that feedback often fails to capture vendor-associated risks. This work documents the online safety of cryptocurrency P2P marketplaces, identifies underlying issues in feedback-based reputation systems, and proposes improved mechanisms for predicting/monitoring risky accounts. We collect data from two cryptocurrency marketplaces, Paxful and LocalCoinSwap (LCS) for 12 months (06/2022--06/2023). The data includes over 396,000 listings, 67,000 vendors, and 4.7 million feedback for Paxful; and about 52,000 listings, 14,000 users, and 146,000 feedback for LCS.First, we show that the current feedback system does not sufficiently convey enough information about risky vendors, and is susceptible to reputation manipulation through user collusion and automation. Second, combining various publicly available information, we build machine learning models to predict account suspension, and achieve a 0.86 F1-score and 0.93 AUC for Paxful. Third, while our models appear to have limited transferability across markets, we identify which features most help account suspension across platforms. Finally, we perform a month-long online evaluation to show that our models are significantly more successful than mere feedback-based reputation schemes at predicting which users will be suspended in the future.",

    "abstract": "Several large financial trading platforms have recently begun implementing “copy trading,” a process by which a leader allows copiers to automatically mirror their trades in exchange for a share of the profits realized. While it has been shown in many contexts that platform design considerably influences user choices—users tend to disproportionately trust rankings presented to them—we would expect that here, copiers exercise due diligence given the money at stake, typically USD 500–2 000 or more. We perform a quantitative analysis of two major cryptocurrency copy-trading platforms, with different default leader ranking algorithms. One of these platforms additionally changed the information displayed during our study. In all cases, we show that the platform UI significantly influences copiers’ decisions. Besides being sub-optimal, this influence is problematic as rankings are often easily gameable by unscrupulous leaders who prey on novice copiers, and they create perverse incentives for all platform users.",

Indeed, in recent years some works have shown\nhow to construct primitives from assumptions based on isogenies of elliptic curves, such as CSIDH, on tensors or on code equivalence problems.\nThis paper presents a bit commitment scheme, built on non-transitive\ngroup actions, which is shown to be secure in the standard model, under the decisional Group Action Inversion Problem. In particular, the\ncommitment is computationally hiding and perfectly binding, and is obtained from a novel and general framework that exploits the properties\nof some orbit-invariant functions, together with group actions. Previous constructions depend on an interaction between the sender and the\nreceiver in the commitment phase, which results in an interactive bit\ncommitment. We instead propose the first non-interactive bit commitment based on group actions. Then we show that, when the sender is\nhonest, the constructed commitment enjoys an additional feature, i.e., it\nis possible to tell whether two commitments were obtained from the same\ninput, without revealing the input. We define the security properties that\nsuch a construction must satisfy, and we call this primitive linkable commitment. Finally, as an example, an instantiation of the scheme using\ntensors with coefficients in a finite field is provided. In this case, the\ninvariant function is the computation of the rank of a tensor, and the\ncryptographic assumption is related to the Tensor Isomorphism problem.",

    "abstract": "A sequential aggregate signature (SAS) scheme allows multiple users to sequentially combine their respective signatures in order to reduce communication costs. Historically, early proposals required the use of trapdoor permutation (e.g., RSA). In recent years, a number of attempts have been made to extend SAS schemes to post-quantum assumptions. Many post-quantum signatures have been proposed in the hash-and-sign paradigm, which requires the use of trapdoor functions and appears to be an ideal candidate for sequential aggregation attempts. However, the hardness in achieving post-quantum one-way permutations makes it difficult to obtain similarly general constructions. Direct attempts at generalizing permutation-based schemes have been proposed, but they either lack formal security or require additional properties on the trapdoor function, which are typically not available for multivariate or code-based functions. In this paper, we propose a (partial-signature) history-free SAS within the probabilistic hash-and-sign with retry paradigm, generalizing existing techniques to generic trapdoor functions. We prove the security of our scheme in the random oracle model and we instantiate our construction with three post-quantum schemes, comparing their compression capabilities. Finally, we discuss how direct extensions of permutation-based SAS schemes are not possible without additional properties, showing the lack of security of two existing multivariate schemes.",

In this paper, we review recent papers that integrate blockchain with SCM and the papers that propose privacy-preserving approaches for public blockchain. Then, we identify the problem in the existing solutions. Additionally, we present an outline of a framework that enables entities in a supply chain to upload their data records anonymously. This framework preserves unlinkability when transferring product ownership. The proposed scheme allows data auditors, who can be the end customers of a supply chain, to access a product's history and verify the authenticity of the data while preserving the privacy of the data uploader. We demonstrate that supply chain data records follow a directed acyclic graph (DAG), similar to the data structure that maintains data records in version control systems (VCS). Hence, this insight could make the framework applicable for anonymous version control systems based on blockchain.",

We calibrate our model to detailed data for Cape Town, South Africa and show that the inclusion of social learning improves the prediction of excess fatalities, reducing the best-fit squared difference from 19.34 to 11.40. The inclusion of social learning both flattens and shortens the curves for infections, hospitalizations, and excess fatalities, which is qualitatively different from flattening the curve by reducing the contact rate or transmission probability through non-pharmaceutical interventions. While social learning reduces infections, this alone is not sufficient to curb the spread of the virus because learning is slower than the rate at which the disease spreads. We use our model to study the efficacy of different vaccination strategies and find that vaccinating vulnerable groups first leads to a 72% reduction in fatalities and a 5% increase in total infections compared to a random-order benchmark. By contrast, using a contact-based vaccination strategy reduces infections by only 0.9% but results in 42% more fatalities than the benchmark.",

We model the problem of an analyst assessing the robustness of coupled networked markets during a crisis—an exogenous negative payoff shock—based only on partial information about the network structure. We give conditions under which exit spirals emerge—abrupt collapses of activity following shocks. Market coupling is a pervasive cause of fragility, creating exit spirals even between networks that are individually robust. The robustness of a coupled network system can be improved if one of two markets is replaced by a centralized one or if links become more correlated across markets.",

    "abstract": "In 2022, the White House released a regulatory framework calling for a “whole-of-government” approach to digital asset innovations. Although justified and necessary, this systems-based strategy discounts the reality that U.S. financial regulation is fundamentally fragmented. There are signs of a turf war between the major digital asset regulators, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Both agencies claim jurisdiction over overlapping classes of digital assets, and several congressional bills recently proposed to radically redistribute this jurisdiction.\nPolicy reforms under the conditions of regulatory fragmentation need empirical data comparing the effect of the regulators’ actions. Empirical literature on digital asset innovations, however, has not paid sufficient attention to the impact of U.S.-specific factors such as regulatory fragmentation. Nor has it explored the importance of U.S. regulators to global digital asset markets. We aim to fill this gap, contribute to the scholarship on financial innovation, and equip policymakers with necessary empirical data.\nOur empirical study compares how the SEC and CFTC regulate crypto primarily via enforcement and how the global digital asset market reacts to the agencies. The market distinguishes between the Commissions and reacts particularly negatively to SEC enforcement. Crypto markets, however, should not be assumed to reject formal law or strong enforcement. Digital asset prices exhibit a more positive reaction to U.S.-led antifraud efforts, indicating that investors understand the value of market integrity.\nWe supply theoretical explanations and underscore that although markets generally view U.S.-led enforcement as costly, some types of regulation may have the potential to improve market quality with positive valuation implications. We hope that our analysis provides new information to scholars and policymakers in evaluating the merits of financial reforms, addressing the current fragmentation in financial regulation, resolving turf wars, and advancing the efforts to promote a whole-of-government approach to digital asset innovation.",

    "abstract": "Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are used in numerous markets for collectibles, art, securities, and commodities. These are different markets, and there is no regulatory framework for all NFTs. To determine a proper legal regime, it is essential to locate the market to which an NFT belongs. This task requires a deep understanding of the economic realities of the associated rights, assets, and transactions. Economic-reality-based interpretations should provide a solid footing for better regulation of NFTs in the United States and other jurisdictions grappling with NFT regulation. The new cryptoasset regime in the EU already incorporates a “substance over form” approach. In the US, courts have been successfully applying the Howey test to examine transactions and schemes and establish whether securities law should apply to cryptoassets. In 2023, the SEC and a US federal district court applied the Howey test to demonstrate why and how securities law built for legacy markets where mainstream assets are fungible could apply to transactions in non-fungible assets. The decisions are an example of establishing economic realities of transactions with novel assets regardless of the underlying technologies on which the assets are built. Admittedly, the application of the Howey test to crypto has been criticized as far-reaching and uncertain. These criticisms of the test’s application may be explained by the lack of a comprehensive regulatory regime tailored to all forms of cryptoassets and by the flaws of what has been described as “regulation by enforcement” in the crypto space. By no means do these arguments prove that the Howey framework is inapplicable to cryptoassets and NFT markets, particularly without any guidance from the US Congress. This chapter concludes by examining how an economic reality approach may help courts and other policymakers ascertain to which market an NFT belongs and which corresponding legal regime should govern.",

    "abstract": "Money is not a simple concept. It is a complex construct consisting of public and private elements. A significant portion of it originates from private-sector entities like banks, against which other private parties have contractual claims. This longstanding partnership between public and private institutions in creating and supplying money is deeply embedded in economic history and, arguably, even the Constitution of the United States. Over the centuries, federal law has specified which firms issue the safest private money and, in doing so, placed private banks in a somewhat privileged position. Non-bank financial firms, for example, typically do not have access to the Fed-provided rails of the clearing and settlement system for inter-bank payments and the master accounts at the Fed.\nThese regulatory fundamentals of the private-public economic partnership are long-standing but imperfect. To name a few issues, banks fail; banks have flaws in their operational coverage and do not serve every part of our economy, with millions of unbanked and underbanked residents in the United States; and the current payment systems exhibit inefficiencies and high costs in transfers, clearing, and settlement. These issues highlight that the public-private money system and its regulatory framing are not ideal, militating in favor of reform.\nThe traditional avenue for improving efficiencies and reducing transaction costs is innovation accompanied by relevant regulatory changes that ensure that innovations do not broadly generate negative externalities affecting consumers, financial markets, and the economy. In this Article, we consider two technology-based initiatives: “central bank digital currencies” (CBDCs) (digital money designed as a representation of fiat money with universal accessibility and the status of a legal tender) and “stablecoins” (privately issued cryptoassets relying on blockchain technology and aiming to maintain stable value, often through collateralization by other assets that have value).\nThese public and private innovations are often presented as a study in contrast and competing products. From a policy perspective, CBDCs are described as safer public money, while stablecoins are pictured as risky private alternatives raising systemic risk concerns. Regulators also worry that stablecoins could create unwanted competition for fiat currencies.\nIn this Article, we change this standard perspective by focusing on how stablecoins may help us reconsider the foundations of the public-private money partnership as it exists to solve the inefficiencies of the current bank-focused system. We identify the pros and cons of the relationship between stablecoins and CBDCs. The United States is unlike many other countries in its historical approach to public monetary sovereignty and the importance of private money and financial institutions. The public does not need to oust the private. Instead, carefully regulated private initiatives should be preserved lest the United States loses the efficiencies of private innovation. Simultaneously, it is self-evident that these assets need to be regulated.\nOur exploration into the coexistence of stablecoins and CBDCs reveals a complex and evolving landscape of technological innovation in the payment and financial sectors. We underscore the need for a nuanced understanding of both private and public digital money, highlighting their distinct roles, potential benefits, and inherent risks within the global financial ecosystem. While stablecoins offer innovative solutions and contribute to diversification within the financial and payment sectors, their regulatory challenges and risk factors necessitate careful oversight. Conversely, the emergence of CBDCs represents a significant step by central banks in modernizing monetary systems and potentially enhancing financial inclusion, but these developments raise their own sets of challenges and risks.\nA key overarching observation is that public money, including CBDCs, and private money, such as stablecoins, will continue to coexist. Regulators need to adapt to this evolving coexistence and plurality of monetary instruments and create reliable regulatory safeguards for this public-private economic partnership. Better, smarter guardrails for the evolving coexistence of private and public money must simultaneously capitalize on the benefits of private innovation, control its negative externalities, safeguard financial stability, and protect consumers.",

    "abstract": "In the evolving domain of blockchain, a critical challenge lies in the performance analysis of blockchains under controlled test conditions. This paper focuses on validating the Blockchain Benchmarking Framework (BBF), developed for the evaluation of blockchain protocols in a controlled environment. The BBF’s robustness and versatility are demonstrated through its application to the official Docker clients of Ripple’s XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum, deployed in private, local and controlled environments. These deployments are utilized to simulate network dynamics, transaction throughput, and resilience in a variety of scenarios. Our methodology encompasses tests ranging from standard operational conditions to adverse scenarios, including node failures and simulated double-spend attacks. These controlled environments are essential for evaluating the BBF’s efficacy in stress testing blockchain protocols and assessing their stability and robustness. The BBF’s ability to accurately capture and analyze performance characteristics is highlighted, providing insights into the operational mechanics, scalability, and resilience of these blockchain clients. The findings emphasize the BBF’s adaptability and effectiveness in managing different blockchain protocols, reaffirming its potential for broader application in pre-launch testing and analysis of blockchain performance. This study contributes to the understanding of how blockchain clients can be preliminarily assessed before mainnet deployment as well as to validate all the design decisions made by the protocol under different settings and synthetic scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Patients and healthcare authorities frequently lack confidence in one another when it comes to the security of their medical records in healthcare settings. Particularly when it comes to patient data management, hospitals are infamous for having inadequate security and have long been the target of cyberattacks. Using blockchain technology to store medical records has drawbacks, including an excessive dependence on centralised cloud servers for key storage, privacy concerns, and the potential for attackers to deduce personal information about patients based on their blockchain activity. A system where patients have autonomy over their medical records and who can view them is a promising scenario. This paper provides a framework for indexing and securing a user’s medical records, with emphasis placed on the healthcare setting using an Ethereum blockchain. The records are secured using biometric authentication and the patient’s Personal Identifiable Information (PII). The patient can grant and revoke access to their records to individual healthcare authorities, and the Interplanetary Name System (IPNS) is used for off-chain record storage. The framework is modular and can be adapted for use in other environments, such as proof of ownership of tickets, and storing travel documents for verification by border control. A smart contract is used to store the hashes of the patient’s iris scans on an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain. Privacy-preserving identifiers are used to anonymise the patient and where their records are stored on the blockchain. Our approach is to the best of our knowledge the only one that simultaneously offers encryption, anonymity, unlinkability and efficient off-chain storage. Additionally, our approach is the only approach we are aware of that provides record revocability.",

We document significant economic benefits of digitization in increasing SMEs’ resilience against such a large shock, as seen through mitigated demand decline, sustainable cash flow, ability to quickly reopen, and positive outlook for growth. After the January 2020 lockdown, firm entries exhibited a V-shaped pattern, with entries of e-commerce firms experiencing a less pronounced immediate drop and a quicker rebound. Moreover, the pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation of existing firms and the industry in multiple dimensions (e.g., altering operation scope to include e-commerce, allowing remote work, and adopting electronic information systems). The effect persists more than one year after reopening, and it is more pronounced for certain sectors, firms in industrial clusters, and areas with more digital inclusion but less financial efficiency, constituting initial evidence for the long-term impact of the pandemic and the supposedly transitory mitigation policies.",

    "abstract": "With the rise of social platforms and digital media (e.g., videos, (live)streaming, and multi-media blogs), firms and brand owners increasingly depend on influencers to attract consumers, who care about both product quality and consumer-influencer interaction. Sellers thus compete in both influencer and product markets. We develop a theory to understand the influencer labor market and its interaction with product competition, under a plausible specification of influencers' value added. We find: (i) more powerful influencers sell better quality products for sellers with weaker direct-sale capacity, facilitating seller competition; (ii) advances in the intermediation technology can lead to non-monotonic changes in influencers' payoff and income inequality; (iii) style pluralism mitigates market concentration by horizontally differentiating the consumer experience but serves as either complements (intermediate style dispersion) or substitutes (small or large dispersions) to vertical product differentiation; and (iv) influencers may inefficiently under-invest in consumer outreach and unidirectional exclusivity can improve welfare in less competitive markets. Collectively, our findings highlight the novelty of the influencer economy and establish several theoretical baselines for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Firms frequently fail to adopt profitable business opportunities even when they do not face informational or liquidity constraints. We explore three behavioral frictions that explain inertia among individuals—present bias, limited memory, and distrust—in a managerial setting. In partnership with a FinTech payments company in Mexico, we randomly offer 33,978 firms the opportunity to pay a lower merchant fee. We vary whether the offer has a deadline, reminder, pre-announced reminder, and the size of the fee reduction. Reminders increase take-up by 15%, suggesting a role of memory. Announced reminders increase take-up by an additional 7%. Survey data reveal the likely mechanism: When the FinTech company follows through with the pre-announced reminder, firms' trust in the offer increases. The deadline does not affect larger firms, implying limited or no present bias, but does increase take-up by 8% for smaller firms. Overall, behavioral frictions contribute significantly to explaining profit-reducing firm behavior.",

    "abstract": "Using a nationally-representative panel of consumer credit records for the US from 1999 to 2021, we document a positive correlation between child and parent homeownership. We propose a new mechanism behind this relationship – parents extract home equity to help finance their child’s home purchase – and we quantify it using fixed effect, event study, local projection, and instrumental variable methods. We find that children whose parents extract equity: (i) are 60-80% more likely to become homeowners; (ii) have lower leverage at origination; and (iii) buy higher-valued homes and at a younger age. The effects are stronger when housing affordability is worse and children’s financial constraints are more likely to bind. Dynastic home equity alone accounts for 20% of the decline in new homeownership for children of low-equity parents following the Global Financial Crisis and 5-10% of the homeownership gap between black and white young adults.",

    "abstract": "Small businesses in the US rely on business credit cards to meet their financing needs. Using a large dataset from a credit reporting agency we document new facts on firms borrowing via business credit cards: average utilization is almost 30%, is significantly higher for smaller and riskier firms, and is correlated with delinquencies. Simultaneously, interest rates on card balances are twice as high as those on term loans. We develop a structural equilibrium model of firms' demand for credit cards, their utilization, and their default choice, accounting for correlation between ex-post utilization and default, as well as bank competition with non-banks. Our model helps rationalize firms' demand for card borrowing as a hedge against cash flow volatility, and enables us to evaluate whether the high rates charged on cards reflect a high cost of lending due to the correlation of utilization and delinquency or high markups. Our estimation suggests high rates primarily reflect the latter. In counterfactual analyses, we explore the provision of business credit cards under stress scenarios featuring concurrent increases in firms credit card utilization and lenders costs. We find that absent large shocks to funding costs, lender profits increase as increased revenue through higher utilization more than offsets the accompanying increases in delinquency and lending costs. Finally, we use the model to explore the equilibrium impact of proposed bank capital rules that add a portion of undrawn credit card balances to bank risk-weighted assets. Such rules tend to reduce bank credit provision, push lending outside the regulated banking sector, while modestly decreasing firm surplus, especially among the smallest, most card-dependent firms.",

    "abstract": "Byzantine fault tolerant algorithms are critical for achieving consistency and reliability in distributed systems, especially in the presence of faults or adversarial behavior. The consensus algorithm used by the XRP Ledger falls into this category. In practice, the implementation of these algorithms is prone to errors, which can lead to undesired behavior in the system. This paper introduces Rocket, a fuzz-testing framework designed for the XRPL consensus algorithm. Rocket enables researchers and developers to automatically inject network and process faults into a locally simulated network of XRPL validator nodes to test if the system behaves as expected. This technique has previously been shown to be effective in finding implementation errors. Rocket has been designed to focus on extensibility and ease of use, enabling users to run complex test scenarios with minimal setup.",

    "abstract": "Avatars are digital representations of oneself used within virtual environments to portray ourselves in the form of our choice. Avatars have taken many shapes and styles since their first appearance in the digital domain. Because of this, new digital environments, such as Metaverse ones, will require a reinvention of this concept, one where it will gain more importance. The better the avatar, the more immersive and realistic the Metaverse experience. In this context, Meta is currently working on a new form of avatars, hyper-realistic ones, which perfectly mimic a full-body digital image of a person. While the possibilities this kind of avatar might entail for immersion and entertainment are undoubted, the risks the use of these avatars might entail from a privacy and data protection perspective are yet to be seen. Considering the quantity and nature of data collected and processed to create these avatars, they can be considered personal data and, in some cases, even biometric data. Thus, in the European Union, the processing of such personal and biometric data should comply with several restrictive conditions imposed by the General Data Protection Regulation. This paper will discuss the lack of clarity about the legal status of personal data from Metaverse avatars. Further, the contribution will propose using blockchain technology as a privacy-enhancing technology, which might help Metaverse users retain control of their personal data. In this regard, blockchain offers a promising alternative due to its decentralized, immutable and transparent nature, maintaining privacy and confidentiality at the same time. Finally, the paper will examine the potential benefits of using blockchain technology to ensure avatar interoperability between virtual worlds in the Metaverse from a legal perspective.",

    "abstract": "In applications involving zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARK), there often exists a requirement for the proof system to be combined with encryption. As a typical example, a user may want to encrypt his identity while proving that his identity satisfies a given authorized function (e.g., credit checks). However, depending on the functionalities and message types, including encryption constraints inside the SNARK input may lead to impractically large proving time and CRS sizes. In this paper, we propose a SNARK-compatible verifiable encryption, or in short SAVER, which is a novel encrypt-and-prove approach to modularize the encryption apart from SNARK circuits. The SAVER holds many useful properties. It is SNARK-compatible: the encryption scheme is combined with an existing SNARK, in a way that the encryptor can prove pre-defined properties while encrypting the message apart from SNARKs. It is additively-homomorphic: the ciphertext holds a homomorphic property by following an ElGamal-like design. It is a verifiable encryption: one can verify arbitrary properties of encrypted messages by using the combined SNARK. It provides a verifiable decryption: the public can verify that the plaintext claimed by the decryptor is equal to the original decryption of ciphertext. It also provides rerandomization: the proof and the ciphertext can be rerandomized as independent objects so that even the encryptor (or prover) herself cannot identify the origin.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the current landscape of option trading platforms for cryptocurrencies, encompassing both centralized and decentralized exchanges. Option contracts in cryptocurrency markets offer functionalities akin to traditional markets, providing investors with tools to mitigate risks, particularly those arising from price volatility, while also allowing them to capitalize on future volatility trends. The paper discusses these applications of option contracts in the context of decentralized finance (DeFi), emphasizing their utility in managing market uncertainties. Despite a recent surge in the trading volume of options contracts on cryptocurrencies, decentralized platforms account for less than 1% of this total volume. Hence, this paper takes a closer look by examining the design choices of these platforms to understand the challenges hindering their growth and adoption. It identifies technical, financial, and adoption-related challenges that decentralized exchanges face and provides commentary on existing platform responses. Subsequently, the paper analyzes the impact of absent options markets on the inefficiencies of automated market maker liquidity. It examines historical on-chain data for 14 ERC20 token pairs on Ethereum. The analysis shows 1143 instances in which deeper liquidity levels, as high as *6 more, could have been achieved by establishing an options market.",

While existing solutions limit their scope to specific types of securities, our solution is generalizable to the tokenization of any securities with any holding rights by representing the security by a fungible token and using separate smart contracts for shareholders to redeem the holding rights. Furthermore, unlike existing solutions, our solution addresses the complications regarding ownership accounting that arise from the decentralized nature of liquidity pools, a pivotal component of the decentralized finance ecosystem. Our solution achieves this by performing accounting off-chain with additional logic for liquidity pools. In this paper, we implement our solution on Ethereum, measuring its gas costs to demonstrate that it is 27% cheaper than existing solutions. We also analyse the liquidity logic of over 90% of liquidity pools on Ethereum, confirming their compatibility with our solution. Moreover, we demonstrate the application of our solution for three use cases: dividend-paying stocks, common stock, and mergers and acquisitions.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents OVer, a framework designed to automatically analyze the behavior of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols when subjected to a \"skewed\" oracle input. OVer firstly performs symbolic analysis on the given contract and constructs a model of constraints. Then, the framework leverages an SMT solver to identify parameters that allow its secure operation. Furthermore, guard statements may be generated for smart contracts that may use the oracle values, thus effectively preventing oracle manipulation attacks. Empirical results show that OVer can successfully analyze all 10 benchmarks collected, which encompass a diverse range of DeFi protocols. Additionally, this paper illustrates that current parameters utilized in the majority of benchmarks are inadequate to ensure safety when confronted with significant oracle deviations. It shows that existing ad-hoc control mechanisms such as introducing delays are often in-sufficient or even detrimental to protect the DeFi protocols against the oracle deviation in the real-world.",

This integration facilitates interoperability while retaining compatibility with existing Ethereum and Move toolchains by preserving high-level language constructs. HEMVM’s unique cross-space operations allow users to interact with contracts across various VMs using any wallet software, effectively resolving the fragmentation in user experience caused by differing VM designs. Our experimental results demonstrate that HEMVM is both fast and efficient, incurring minimal overhead (less than 4.4%) for intra-VM transactions and achieving up to 9300 TPS for cross-VM transactions. Our results also show that the cross-space operations in HEMVM are sufficiently expressive to support complex decentralized finance interactions across multiple VMs. Finally, the parallelized prototype of HEMVM shows performance improvements up to 44.8% compared to the sequential version of HEMVM under workloads with mixed transaction types.",

The World Bank recognizes the potential of these platforms to reach an estimated 1.4 billion adults worldwide. Effective Blockchain governance is crucial for the success of these platforms. This paper explores the influence of Blockchain governance on value creation within such platforms. Through a case study of a crowdlending platform aimed at financial inclusion, we identify three mechanisms by which governance can enhance value creation: by minimizing investment risk through the implementation of a smart contract-driven compensation scheme; by bolstering trust and transparency via a decentralized decision-making process; and by encouraging initiatives that promote sustainability and growth within the communities they serve.",

Analysing on-chain data, we report that FTX heavily relied on leveraging and misusing its native token, FTT, and we show how this behaviour exacerbated the company’s fragile financial situation. To gain further insights into the downfall, we employ state-of-the-art network science instruments to model the evolutionary dependency structures of 199 cryptocurrencies on an hourly basis, and we investigate tick-by-tick public trades at the time of the events. We identify the collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem as the pivotal event that triggered a significant decrease in the exchange’s liquidity. Results suggest that the crash was actively accelerated by Binance tweets causing a systemic reaction in the cryptocurrency market. Finally, identifying the actors who mostly benefited from the FTX’s collapse and highlighting a generalised trend toward centralisation in the crypto space, we emphasise the importance of genuinely decentralised finance for a transparent, future digital economy.",

Despite these concerns, policy interventions targeting cryptocurrency operations in the pursuit of sustainability have largely been ineffective. Some were abandoned for fear of jeopardizing innovation, whereas others failed due to the highly globalized nature of blockchain systems. In search of a more effective angle for energy policy measures, this study adopts a consumer-centric perspective, examining the sentiments of Nigerian cryptocurrency users (n=158) toward Bitcoin’s sustainability, a representative cryptocurrency known for its high electricity demand. Three main findings emerged: 1) Even among those self-identifying as highly knowledgeable, most considerably underestimated Bitcoin’s electricity consumption. 2) Participants with a more accurate understanding of Bitcoin’s energy demand were more inclined to support sustainability measures. 3) Most of this supportive cohort viewed private entities as the primary stakeholders for implementing such measures. Given these findings, we suggest that consumer education should be at the forefront of policy initiatives aimed at cryptocurrency sustainability.",

By its \"plutocratic\" nature, it requires a more intricate economic design to ensure its resilience and safety. In this paper, we establish a generalizable, transferable PoS framework that encompasses the interactions and relationships between protocol reserves, treasury, reward pot and transaction fees and staking rewards. With appropriate specifications and configurations, we are able to apply the model to two major PoS protocols: Hedera and Cardano. The dynamic model can inform us of protocol trajectories, including the evolution of the treasury and reserve balances as well as the level of decentralization. Our framework serves as a handbook to investigate the staking behaviors and reward dynamics with the concomitant effects on the crypto economics of various PoS-based systems.",

    "abstract": "While blockchain and distributed ledger technology offer immense potential for applications in transparency, security, efficiency, censorship resistance, and more, they have been criticized due to the energy-intensive nature of the proof of work consensus algorithm, particularly in the context of Bitcoin mining. We systematically explore the state-of-the-art regarding the relationship between Bitcoin mining and grid decarbonization. We specifically focus on the role of flexible load response through proof of work mining as a potential contributor to renewable energy penetration and net decarbonization of the energy grid. The existing literature has not comprehensively examined this area, leading to conflicting views. We address the gap, analyzing the capabilities and limitations of Bitcoin mining in providing flexible load response services. Our findings show that renewable-based mining could potentially drive a net-decarbonizing effect on energy grids, although key adaptations in mining practices are needed to fully realize this potential. Overall, the paper suggests a re-evaluation of the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, highlighting its potential role as a facilitator for renewable energy expansion, and decarbonization more broadly.",

    "abstract": "During the last half century, the concept of shared ledger systems that offer a single source of truth has challenged traditional bookkeeping, leading to innovations such as the resource-event-agent (REA) accounting framework, triple-entry accounting (TEA), and blockchain. Despite these advancements, the historical development of shared ledger systems remains under-researched and unclear, with the influence of REA on TEA particularly overlooked. This study aims to fill this gap by conducting a genealogical analysis of shared ledger systems, with a focus on tracing the development of TEA and its historical byproduct of the REA framework designed by McCarthy. Through a comprehensive literature review and interviews with pioneers in REA, TEA, and blockchain, we uncover the missing link between REA and TEA. Our findings suggest that the current explosion of shared ledger systems results from the convergence of three parallel research streams, occasionally interacting with each other. We correct common misconceptions, acknowledge the influence of key individuals, and map out the overlapping paths of REA, TEA, and blockchain. By elucidating the historical evolution of shared ledger systems, this study contributes to the academic debate and fosters further discourse among researchers in REA, TEA, and blockchain, thereby enhancing the potential applications within these fields.",

    "abstract": "Avatars are digital representations of oneself, allowing us to freely express our identity, personality, and appearance. Further, they express one’s mood and enable interaction with others in virtual worlds such as the Metaverse. Nonetheless, avatars could also entail multiple challenges from a data protection perspective: are hyper-realistic Metaverse avatars personal data and, more specifically, biometric data? Is there a legal basis for their processing by Metaverse platforms if that is the case? What does the potential avatar’s interoperability entail from a data protection perspective? This paper will discuss the lack of clarity about the legal status of data from Metaverse avatars. Further, the contribution will propose using blockchain technology for avatar’s data governance to counterbalance the potential data protection risks posed by using hyper-realistic Metaverse avatars. In this regard, blockchain offers a promising alternative due to its decentralized, immutable, and transparent nature. Finally, the paper will examine the potential benefits of using blockchain technology to ensure avatar’s interoperability between virtual worlds in the Metaverse from a legal perspective.",

    "abstract": "Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, blockchain technology has undergone significant development and demonstrated its potential to revolutionize several industries. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) enable the transparent recording and secure sharing of data across a network of participants in a decentralized manner. However, the adoption of DLTs has been hindered by the existence of numerous protocols and diverging standards, leading to the creation of isolated ‘walled gardens’ where each blockchain operates independently. Achieving interoperability between different blockchains is thus essential for the broader application of the blockchain technology beyond cryptocurrencies. So far, blockchain interoperability has been analysed primarily from a technical perspective, with a noticeable gap in scholarly contributions addressing its legal implications.\nThis article is the first attempt to examine how EU competition law and data protection law will be affected by, and can support, the evolution towards interoperable blockchains. To this objective, it first provides the background by briefly explaining blockchain interoperability and its underlying mechanisms, as well as demonstrates the benefits of fostered interoperability and the challenges preventing it from fully materializing. As regards a competition law assessment, our analysis identified three potential areas that might be affected by blockchain interoperability: collusion and information exchanges, anti-competitive foreclosure, and standardization. A data protection analysis focuses on evaluating the potential impacts of blockchain interoperability on the principles of accountability, data minimization, and purpose limitation, as well as on the rights of individuals, particularly the ‘right to be forgotten’.\nThe article concludes that blockchain interoperability does not introduce entirely new legal challenges beyond those already identified in the existing literature on blockchain’s compatibility with competition law and data protection law. However, it has the potential to exacerbate these challenges. By enhancing the degree of data sharing among different parties, blockchain interoperability may foster collusion and complicate compliance with the GDPR. At the same time, blockchain interoperability could lower market entry barriers and reduce market concentration, thereby decreasing the risk of foreclosure practices. Our analysis also revealed that, in the near future, particular attention should be paid to the standardization efforts surrounding blockchain interoperability, which are likely to become a crucial nexus between blockchain technology and competition law.",

This practice exposes software to vulnerabilities in the form of undetected bugs in direct and indirect dependencies, as demonstrated by the Crowdstrike and HeartBleed bugs. The economic costs resulting from such vulnerabilities can be staggering. We study a directed network of 52,897 software dependencies across 16,102 Python repositories, guided by a strategic model of network formation that incorporates both observable and unobservable heterogeneity. Using a scalable variational approximation of the conditional distribution of unobserved heterogeneity, we show that outsourcing code to other software packages by creating dependencies generates negative externalities. Modeling the propagation of risk in networks of software packages as an epidemiological process, we show that increasing protection of dependencies based on popular heuristics is ineffective at reducing systemic risk. By contrast, AI-assisted coding enables developers to replace dependencies with in-house code and reduces systemic risk.",

    "abstract": "Value at Risk (VaR) estimates the maximum loss a portfolio may incur at a given confidence level over a specified time, while expected shortfall (ES) determines the probability weighted losses greater than VaR. VaR has recently been replaced by (but remains a crucial step in the computation of) ES by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) as the primary metric for banks to forecast market risk and allocate the relevant amount of regulatory market risk capital. The aim of the study is to introduce a more accurate approach of measuring VaR and hence ES determined using loss forecast accuracy. VaR (hence ES) is unobservable and depends on subjective measures like volatility, more accurate (loss forecast) estimates of both are constantly sought. Modelling the volatility of asset returns as a stochastic process, so a Kalman filter (which distinguishes and isolates noise from data using Bayesian statistics and variance reduction) is used to estimate both market risk metrics. A variety of volatility estimates, including the Kalman filter's recursive approach, are used to measure VaR and ES. Loss forecast accuracy is then computed and compared. The Kalman filter produces the most accurate loss forecast estimates in periods of both calm and volatile markets. The Kalman filter provides the most accurate forecasts of future market risk losses compared with standard methods which results in more accurate provision of regulatory market risk capital.",

Checking a smart contract for security vulnerabilities is recognized as an important problem in both research and practice. Motivated by recent empirical work that suggests that existing tools suffer high numbers of false positives and negatives for vulnerabilities that belong to commonly-occurring classes, we ask: for even one such class of vulnerabilities, can there exist a tool that is highly effective? We answer in the affirmative by construction: for the class of unchecked low-level calls, checking for which is undecidable in general and PSPACE-complete under finitizing assumptions we adopt, we propose an approach for Ethereum smart contracts that comprises a reduction to model-checking, encoding the property in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and use of an off-the-shelf model checker. We find that across almost 200 smart contracts drawn from curated and “wild” datasets from the publicly available benchmark that underlies the prior empirical work that points out that existing tools suffer high numbers of false positives and negatives, our approach is highly effective in that we see zero false positives and negatives.",

    "abstract": "Modularity is indispensable for scaling automatic verification to large programs. However, modularity also introduces challenges because it requires inferring and abstracting the behavior of functions as summaries – formulas that relate the function’s inputs and outputs. For programs manipulating memory, summaries must include the function’s frame, i.e., how the content memory is affected by the execution of the function. In SMT-based model-checking, memory is often modeled with (unbounded) logical arrays and expressing frames generally requires universally quantified formulas. Such formulas significantly complicate inference and subsequent reasoning and are thus to be avoided. In this paper, we present a technique to encode the memory that is bounded explicitly, eliminating the need for quantified summaries. We build on the insight that the size of frames can be statically known. This enables replacing unbounded arrays with finite maps – a finite collection of key-value pairs. Specifically, we develop a new static analysis to infer the finite parts of a function’s frame. We then extend the theory of arrays to the theory of finite maps and show that satisfiability of Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) over finite maps is reducible to satisfiability of CHCs over the base theory. Finally, we propose a new encoding from imperative programs to CHCs that uses finite maps to model explicitly the finite memory passed in function calls. The result is a new verification strategy that preserves the advantages of modularity while reducing the need for quantified frames. We have implemented this approach in SeaHorn, a state-of-the-art CHC-based software model checker for LLVM. An evaluation on Linux Drivers from SV-COMP shows the effectiveness of our technique.",

We introduce a novel agreement protocol, called Antipaxos, that instead reaches agreement on a collection of proposals using an efficient leaderless fast path when the environment is synchronous and failure-free, and falls back on a more elaborate slow path to handle other cases. We first specify the main safety property of Antipaxos by formalizing a new agreement problem called k-Interactive Consistency (k-IC). Then, we present a solution to this problem in the Byzantine failure model. We prove safety and liveness, and also present an experimental performance evaluation in the Amazon cloud. Our experiments show that Antipaxos achieves several-fold higher failure-free peak throughput than Mir-BFT. The inherent efficiency of our approach stems from the low message complexity of the fast path: agreement on n batches of conflict-prone proposals is achieved using only Θ(n²) messages in one consensus cycle, or Θ(n) amortized messages per batch.",

As an extension, a trapdoor-VDF is a VDF with a shortcut that speeds up the evaluation process. This paper presents a new class of trapdoor-VDFs featuring a large ensemble of trapdoors for each instantiation of the function. This way, a client can randomly choose a private trapdoor from the ensemble, thereby using it to encapsulate a secret to the future as a unique puzzle. To solve the puzzle, the server, which does not know the trapdoor, requires a prescribed number of sequential steps to evaluate the function. Any client can efficiently verify the correctness of the server’s evaluation with zero knowledge of the trapdoor being used. We present an approach for constructing the proposed class of trapdoor-VDFs based on bilinear pairings and a long walk on supersingular isogeny graphs. Finally, we examine the security of our construction under trapdoor-VDF security notions.",

In this work, we propose an integrated solution, namely ChronoCloak, which aims to address both the premature exposure of the sender data and the privacy preservation of the receiver interaction. ChronoCloak allows a sender to transmit a set of secrets through a puzzle, which can be solved via a lengthy computation. Upon solving the puzzle, the receiver recovers only a subset of the secrets that is oblivious to the sender. It also allows the receiver to securely outsource the computation (with public verifiability), yet only the intended receiver can retrieve a subset of secrets using the puzzle solution. We also propose an ideal functionality for ChronoCloak and provide a generic construction implementing this functionality in the random oracle model, using an ideal oblivious transfer functionality and a time lock-like function.",

In this article, we present a code-based signcryption tag-KEM scheme. We utilize a code-based signature and an IND-CCA2 (adaptive chosen ciphertext attack) secure version of McEliece’s encryption scheme. The proposed scheme uses an equivalent subcode as a public code for the receiver, making the NP-completeness of the subcode equivalence problem be one of our main security assumptions. We then base the signcryption tag-KEM to design a code-based hybrid signcryption scheme. A hybrid scheme deploys asymmetric- as well as symmetric-key encryption. We give security analyses of both our schemes in the standard model and prove that they are secure against IND-CCA2 (indistinguishability under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack) and SUF-CMA (strong existential unforgeability under chosen message attack).",

In this work, we address the problem of evaluating and constructing a strategy for computing the large smooth-degree isogeny in the multi-processor setting by formulating them as scheduling problems with dependencies. The contribution of this work is two-fold. For the strategy evaluation, we transform strategies into task dependency graphs and apply precedence-constrained scheduling algorithms to them in order to find their costs. For the strategy construction, we construct strategies from smaller parts that are optimal solutions of integer programming representing the problem. We show via experiments that the proposed two techniques together offer more than 13% reduction in the strategy costs compared to the best current results by Hutchinson and Karabina presented at Indocrypt 2018.",

    "abstract": "Strategies and their evaluations play important roles in speeding up the computation of large smooth-degree isogenies. The concept of optimal strategies for such computation was introduced by De Feo et al., and virtually all implementations of isogeny-based protocols have adopted this approach, which is provably optimal for single-core platforms. In spite of its inherent sequential nature, several recent works have studied ways of speeding up this isogeny computation by exploiting the rich parallelism available in vectorized and multi-core platforms. One obstacle to taking full advantage of this parallelism, however, is that De Feo et al.’s strategies are not necessarily optimal in multi-core environments. To illustrate how the speed of vectorized and parallel isogeny computation can be improved at the strategylevel, we present two novel software implementations that utilize a state-of-the-art evaluation technique, called precedence-constrained scheduling (PCS), presented by Phalakarn et al., with our proposed strategies crafted for these environments. Our first implementation relies only on the parallelism provided by multi-core processors. The second implementation targets multi-core processors supporting the latest generation of the Intel’s Advanced Vector eXtensions (AVX) technology, commonly known as AVX-512IFMA instructions. To better handle the computational concurrency associated with PCS, we equip both implementations with extensive synchronization techniques. Our first implementation outperforms the implementation of Cervantes-Vázquez et al. by yielding up to 14.36% reduction in the execution time, when targeting platforms with two- to four-core processors. Our second implementation, equipped with four cores, achieves up to 34.05% reduction in the execution time compared to the single-core implementation of Cheng et al. of CHES 2022.",

This paper introduces a new batching strategy for computing multiple group actions in CSIDH, which is essential for constructing cryptographic schemes such as zero-knowledge proofs and signature schemes. Two variants of the batching strategy are presented in this work, suited to different security requirements and application contexts. In the first scenario, we focus on situations where group actions are public, aiming to reduce CSIDH’s computational cost. Using our strategy, we show that computational costs can be significantly reduced, making it a viable option for schemes in which efficiency is critical. This variant reduces the computational requirements of group actions by roughly up to 14% when compared to non-batched action evaluation. The second variant is towards constant-time group actions, and it reduces computational costs while maintaining resilience to side-channel timing attacks. This article also introduces a new constant-time implementation of CSIDH that, when combined with the second variant, reduces the computation costs of secret action sets by roughly up to 8% compared to individual computation using state-of-the-art constant-time algorithms, while the new constant time alone reduces computation by approximately up to 4%.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain integration in industries like online advertising is hindered by its connectivity limitations to off-chain data. These industries heavily rely on precise counting systems to collect and analyze off-chain data. This requires mechanisms, often called oracles, to feed off-chain data into smart contracts. However, current oracle solutions are ill-suited for counting systems since the oracles do not know when to expect the data, posing a significant challenge. To address this, we present CountChain, a decentralized oracle network for counting systems. In CountChain, data is received by all oracle nodes, and any node can submit a proposition request. Each proposition contains enough data to evaluate the occurrence of an event. Only randomly selected nodes participate in a game to evaluate the truthfulness of each proposition by providing proof and some stake. Finally, the propositions with the outcome of True increments the counter in a smart contract. Thus, instead of a contract calling oracles for data, in CountChain, the oracles call a smart contract when the data is available. Furthermore, we present a formal analysis and experimental evaluation of the system's parameters on over half a million data points to obtain optimal system parameters. In such conditions, our gametheoretical analysis demonstrates that a Nash equilibrium exists wherein all rational parties participate with honesty.",

This issue accounts for up to $82B of annual revenue loss for the honest parties. This loss can be significantly reduced if there is a precise and trusted decentralized mechanism. This paper presents AdChain, a decentralized, distributed, and verifiable solution that detects and minimizes online advertisement impression discrepancy rate. AdChain aims to establish trust by acquiring multiple independent agents that receive and record log-level data and a consensus protocol that determines the validity of each ad data. AdChain is scalable, efficient, and compatible with the current infrastructure. Our experimental evaluation on over half a million ad data points discovers systems parameters to achieve an accuracy of 98% to decrease the ad discrepancy rate from up to 20% to 2%. Our cost analysis shows that, on average, active nodes on AdChain can generate a profit comparable to miners on main Blockchain networks like Bitcoin.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the economic implications of privacy dark patterns (PDPs) through which firms ``wisely'' play privacy games. It is believed that PDPs advantage firms by deceiving consumers. However, it could also hinder firms' credibility. Thus, we aim to examine whether PDPs always benefit firms and hurt consumers. We also seek to answer whether market forces are sufficient to keep PDPs at relatively low levels. Our results show that PDPs make users weakly worse off and the seller weakly better off. Nevertheless, the seller has incentives to not utilize any PDPs when users' privacy cost is high, and the ratio of privacy concern and search cost is either too high or too low under which market shrinkage effect dominates market division effect. Finally, we show that a welfare maximizing social planner would allow the presence of PDPs when users' privacy cost is sufficiently low.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain systems allow for securely keeping shared records of transactions in a decentralised way. This is enabled by algorithms called consensus mechanisms. Proof-of-work is the most prominent consensus mechanism, but environmentally unsustainable. Here, we focus on proof-of-stake, its best-known alternative. Importantly, decentralised decision-making power is not an inherent feature of blockchain systems, but a technological possibility. Numerous security incidents illustrate that decentralised control cannot be taken for granted. We therefore study how key parameters affect the degree of decentralisation in proof-of-stake blockchain systems. Based on a real-world implementation of a proof-of-stake blockchain system, we conduct agent-based simulations to study how a range of parameters impact decentralisation. The results suggest that high numbers of initial potential validator nodes, large transactions, a high number of transactions, and a very high or very low positive validator network growth rate increase decentralisation. We find weak support for an impact of changes in transaction fees and initial stake distributions. Our study highlights how blockchain challenges our understanding of decentralisation in information systems research, and contributes to understanding the governance mechanisms that lead to decentralisation in proof-of-stake blockchain systems as well as to designing proof-of-stake blockchain systems that are prone to decentralisation and therefore more secure.",

Staking governs DAOs instead of centralized authorities. As a new organizing form, DAOs require careful theoretical consideration. We conceptualize the vehicle of consensus-based governance as digital consensus. Using an agent-based simulation model, this paper aims to extend meta-organization theory to incorporate an organizational learning perspective. We benchmark the DAOs using two well-established organizing forms, namely autonomous and hierarchical organizations. We find that hierarchies outperform DAOs in static environments, whereas DAOs outperform hierarchies in turbulent environments, with autonomies only excelling with intensive experimentation. Our analyses allow us to characterize DAOs as evolving through a staggered process of polarization and homogenization, as opposed to autonomies’ continuous polarization and hierarchies’ continuous homogenization. Such a staggered process can be affected by several factors (e.g., voting thresholds, token asymmetry, and contributor incentives).",

    "abstract": "Natural disasters and disease outbreaks cause substantial social turbulence and economic damage. The survival and continued operation of local small businesses and entrepreneurs are critical to the development activities in post-disaster recovery. However, these small businesses and entrepreneurs face greater challenges in accessing funding through traditional channels during a crisis. Crowdlending, also known as peer-to-peer microfinancing, has been successfully used to bypass traditional channels and raise funds directly from crowd lenders. However, it is unclear if such platforms can also be effectively used in the aftermath of crises, given that disasters induce both prosocial motivations and risk considerations in lender responses. To understand the operational implications of crowdlending for small businesses, we examine how crowdlenders respond to loan requests during a crisis and what factors moderate their responses. Drawing on the literature on disaster management and crowdlending, we hypothesize that lenders respond positively to loan requests from crisis-affected areas, and such responses are moderated by fundraising objectives and the lender's national culture. With observational data from an influential crowdlending platform and the 2014 Ebola outbreak as the treatment in a natural experiment design, we find that, on average, lenders respond positively to loan requests from crisis-affected areas, and they tend to favor loan requests emphasizing economic rather than social objectives. Furthermore, lenders from collectivistic cultures are more likely to respond positively during a crisis than lenders from individualistic ones. Our study contributes to research and practice in disaster management, particularly small business operations management during crises, by showing that crowdlending can be a useful fundraising channel for small businesses, which is meaningful for post-disaster economic development and recovery. We also offer implications for the recent conversation on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic by analyzing and discussing the similarities and differences between the Ebola outbreak and the COVID-19 pandemic.",

A stochastic factor process drives asset price dynamics as well as the client’s goal amount and income. We prove the weak dynamic programming principle for the value function of our control problem, which we show to be the unique viscosity solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We develop an equivalent and computationally efficient representation of the Hamiltonian, which yields the optimal portfolio within a factor-dependent opportunity set defined by the maximum and minimum variance hypersurfaces. Our analysis shows that it is optimal to fund an expiring goal up to the level where the marginal benefit of additional fundedness is exceeded by the opportunity cost of diverting wealth from future goals. An all-or-nothing investor is more risk averse towards an approaching goal deadline if she is well funded, but more risk seeking if she is not on track with upcoming goals, compared to an investor with flexible goals.",

In response to the centralization driven by MEV, Ethereum introduced the Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) framework, which separates the roles of block builders and proposers. We provide a game-theoretical analysis of block building that highlights the incentives driving the strategic allocation of order flow to builders, who then compete for block building rights auctioned off by validators. Our analysis demonstrates that the builder market tends toward centralization: larger builders, by attracting more order flow, enhance their market dominance in a self-reinforcing cycle, consistent with observed trends on the Ethereum blockchain. This centralization poses risk to the blockchain, such as weakened security through a single point of failure, and increasing ability of builders to extract rent from users and validators. Moreover, it disrupts the intended division of labor between builders and validators, jeopardizing the sustainability of the modular blockchain architecture that PBS aims to establish.",

We show that private transaction pools can reduce these inefficiencies and enhance welfare.

Validators’ reluctance to forgo rents from frontrunning (maximal extractable value) results in partial adoption equilibrium, where frontrunning persists. Our empirical analysis of the Flashbots private pool on Ethereum supports these predictions, demonstrating increased validator revenues, higher private pool usage by users facing greater potential losses, and convergence of attackers’ cost-to-revenue ratios to one in private pools.",

This paper compares the current-day arbitration laws of Australia, Cayman Islands, European Union, India, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, Qatar, Philippines, the United Kingdom, and the United States, which are considered arbitration friendly. The paper confirms that the respective arbitration laws do not clearly and unequivocally provide for a robot to be used as an arbitrator. It is well understood that robots today do not have the emotional or social intelligence, such as bias, that a human naturally brings to the arbitration table. There are four streams of studies on this issue: AI-powered arbitrator, AI arbitration, AI-assisted arbitration, and a robot as arbitrator. However, none of these is clearly defined by arbitration law. This paper argues that the current day laws do not provide for robots to replace the human arbitrator, and must retain the status quo. Any law reform to allow a robot to replace the human arbitrator, would be a jump too far, and would significantly diminish the long-standing reputation that arbitration has as an effective legal mechanism for resolving international commercial and investor-state disputes.",

    "abstract": "Cybersecurity has evolved into one of the most important and complex developments of the new digital economy. Today and going forward it will underpin economic, social and environmental development across the entire digital economy. Furthermore, cybersecurity is interconnected with personal and commercial data. Coupled together, or, independently they are impacting the entire supply chain of business, from manufacture, distribution, sale and consumption. This article demonstrates the developments in Australia pertaining to directors’ and officers’ obligations to ensure they have developed robust cybersecurity self-regulatory systems. It draws upon a recent 2022 Federal Court of Australia decision of Australian Securities and Investments Commission v RI Advice Group Pty Ltd. that has raised the stakes in this area of the law.",
