# UBRI Paper Classification System

This system uses OpenAI's API to automatically classify all papers in the UBRI dataset into specific blockchain research categories.

## üìÅ **Folder Structure**

All classification-related files are now organized in the `classification/` folder:

```
classification/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ classify_papers.py              # Main classification script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_classification.py          # Test script for small samples
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ view_classifications.py         # Interactive results viewer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLASSIFICATION_README.md        # This documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ paper_classifications.json      # Complete classification results
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_classifications.json       # Test results
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ classification_summary_report.txt # Human-readable summary
```

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set OpenAI API Key**:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Test Classification (Recommended First Step)

Run a test on a small sample to verify everything works:

```bash
cd classification
python test_classification.py
```

This will:
- Test with 5 papers
- Show sample classifications
- Save results to `test_classifications.json`

### 2. Full Classification

Run the complete classification on all papers:

```bash
cd classification
python classify_papers.py
```

This will:
- Process all ~496 papers
- Take approximately 10-15 minutes (with rate limiting)
- Save results to `paper_classifications.json`
- Generate a summary report `classification_summary_report.txt`

### 3. View Results

Use the interactive viewer to explore results:

```bash
cd classification
python view_classifications.py
```

Or view a specific results file:
```bash
cd classification
python view_classifications.py your_results_file.json
```

## Output Files

### `paper_classifications.json`

    }
  ],
  "categories": [...]
}
```

### `classification_summary_report.txt`
Human-readable summary with:
- Overall statistics
- Category distribution
- Top universities
- Sample papers by category

## Interactive Viewer Features

The viewer (`view_classifications.py`) provides:

1. **Summary Statistics** - Overall numbers and distributions
2. **Papers by Category** - Browse papers grouped by topic

## Cost Estimation

Using GPT-4o-mini:
- ~496 papers √ó ~$0.001 per classification = ~$0.50 total cost
- Rate limited to avoid API limits

## Customization

### Modify Categories
Edit the `classification_categories` list in `classify_papers.py` to change or add categories.

### Adjust Batch Size
Change the `batch_size` parameter in `classify_all_papers()` to process more/fewer papers at once.

### Change Model
Modify the `model` parameter in the API call to use different OpenAI models.

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues
- Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set
- Check API key validity and billing status

### Rate Limits
- The script includes delays to avoid rate limits
- If you hit limits, increase the `time.sleep()` delay

### Memory Issues
- For large datasets, consider processing in smaller batches
- Monitor memory usage during processing

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the troubleshooting section
2. Review the test output first
3. Verify your OpenAI API key and billing status
